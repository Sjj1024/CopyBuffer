                                                The Buffer team is heading out
                                                on our first retreat since 2019!
                                                I asked the retreat veterans for
                                                advice on making the most of the
                                                trip as a newbie.

                                                teammates how to thrive at the
                                                company. Their guidance will
                                                stay with me for the rest of my
                                                career — and it might help you,
                                                too.

It’s by design! We’ve been intentionally investing in building a team of Buffer creators as a company-wide initiative.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the core of this work is a simple belief: being creators ourselves will continue to set Buffer up for long-term success.

That means experiencing the same hesitations, creative blocks, and cold-start challenges our customers face; and learning how to move through them.

Which is why I’m especially excited to share a behind-the-scenes look at something we’re bringing back: our public API!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’m Amanda, the product manager leading the charge on this project, and I wanted to give you a big-picture view of why we’re rebuilding the API, who it’s for, and where we’re headed next.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"a-quick-look-back-the-buffer-api-origin-story\"\u003eA quick look back: The Buffer API origin story\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe first launched Buffer’s public API in 2012 with a small but mighty group of 15 integrations — think Pocket, IFTTT, and other early web favorites. Fun fact: a few now-competing social tools actually started out as Buffer integrations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur API was built with REST (the standard at the time) and allowed developers to do things like schedule posts and manage profiles. We kept user privacy top of mind from day one and built out docs to help folks get started. By 2019, over 47,000 clients were using the API.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut by then, the landscape had changed a lot. Following privacy scandals such as Cambridge Analytica, social network platforms including Meta (Facebook), Pinterest, LinkedIn, and X (formerly Twitter) introduced stricter terms of service and data privacy requirements. To comply, we had to tighten control over our API usage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso around this time, our priorities were shifting internally. We decided to stop allowing new applications because we knew we couldn’t offer the dev experience we wanted — and our partners deserved — without a bigger investment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"the-comeback-story\"\u003eThe comeback story\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat bigger investment I mentioned? We’re ready for it now. There are a few big reasons we’re investing in rebuilding Buffer’s API — and they all come back to doing right by our community.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s a deeper look:\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"we-want-to-build-this-with-you\"\u003eWe want to build this with you\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eTransparency and collaboration have always been part of our DNA. Rebuilding the API gives us a chance to create something that’s more powerful, more accessible, and genuinely useful — with feedback and input from the people who’ll actually use it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"we-want-to-unlock-new-possibilities-for-small-businesses-and-indie-devs\"\u003eWe want to unlock new possibilities for small businesses and indie devs\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur mission is all about helping small businesses and creators grow sustainably. A modern API removes barriers and opens the door for folks to customize Buffer to their needs — or even build something entirely new on top of it. (We love to see it.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"we-can%E2%80%99t-%E2%80%94-and-shouldn%E2%80%99t-%E2%80%94-build-everything-ourselves\"\u003eWe can’t — and shouldn’t — build everything ourselves\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur users have edge cases, workflows, and needs that don’t always fit neatly into our core roadmap — and that’s okay! A more flexible, developer-friendly API lets others in our community build the tools they need, without waiting on us to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"we-want-a-ui-that%E2%80%99s-powerful-and-adaptable\"\u003eWe want a UI that’s powerful and adaptable\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we rebuild, we’re thinking ahead to a future where Buffer’s UI can flex and adapt based on what users actually need — no bloat, no clutter. A better API helps make that possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"the-tech-matters-too\"\u003eThe tech matters too\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur old API was showing its age. Rebuilding it gives us a stronger, more secure foundation to work from — one that’s scalable, well-documented, and ready for whatever comes next (AI tools, automation, you name it).\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"who-we%E2%80%99re-building-the-new-api-for\"\u003eWho we’re building the new API for\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we rebuild the API, we’re thinking about two main groups of people who’ll be using it — both equally important, and both doing really exciting things.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"1-power-users-personalizing-buffer\"\u003e1. Power users personalizing Buffer\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese folks are customizing Buffer for their own workflows — think social media managers, marketers, or just super-organized creators who want things to run \u003cem\u003etheir\u003c/em\u003e way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhether it’s automation, no-code tools, or building custom dashboards, we want them to be able to use the API to save time and get creative, no formal dev background required.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s a great example of how that might look from one of our engineers, Andrew Yates, who also created his own app, Alpenglow, as a side project. (For context, Alpenglow helps pinpoint the exact time a sunrise or sunset will be at its most beautiful in any given location.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith the API, he’s connected Buffer and Alpenglow to create this workflow:\u003c/p\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eUsers can submit sunrise or sunset photo reports in the app.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf they give permission, I send the photo and caption straight to Buffer’s drafts.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith this relatively simple set-up, Andrew had over 3,000 drafts waiting for him in Buffer — enough for more than two years of content, he predicts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIncredible, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"2-developers-building-integrations-for-others\"\u003e2. Developers building integrations for others\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen there’s the folks building third-party integrations — tools that work \u003cem\u003ewith\u003c/em\u003e Buffer and serve entire communities or organizations. These projects usually need more technical depth: authentication, error handling, privacy compliance, the works.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd while “developer” used to mean someone who knew their way around a terminal, that definition is evolving fast.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks to AI and low-code tools, the developer community is getting more diverse — which is exactly why we’re focused on making our docs, tooling, and onboarding super approachable. (More on that coming soon!)\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"watch-this-space-for-more\"\u003eWatch this space for more\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy rebuilding the API, we’re not just strengthening our technical foundations. We’re doubling down on our commitment to the Buffer community. This work is about more than code. It’s about creating a more open, flexible platform that gives developers, small businesses, and everyday users the tools they need to build what works for them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI hope you’re as excited about this as I am!

Over the years, we've experimented with different approaches, and after 14 Retreats, we've learned a lot. In the past, we'd go to Finance and Leadership and simply ask, \"What's our budget?\" — usually thinking in terms of a per-person amount rather than an overall figure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese days, we're exploring a more proactive route: starting with what we \u003cem\u003eneed\u003c/em\u003e to create a successful Retreat experience, then working backward to see what's possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith a clear vision, strong non-negotiables, and a solid sense of what makes a Buffer Retreat magical, we're finding it easier to advocate for the pieces that matter most. Of course, there will always be trade-offs, but our goal is to strike the sweet spot where the budget supports a meaningful and connected experience for our entire team.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe're still exploring the best way to align on this internally, but so far, building the plan around the \u003cem\u003eexperience\u003c/em\u003e (rather than just the numbers) feels like a worthwhile path to pursue. Stay tuned, we'll likely share more in a future debrief!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the past, we've spent around $4,000–$4,500 per Bufferoo to bring Retreat magic to life. Multiply that by 70 teammates and, yep, you're looking at $280,000–$315,000 for the full shebang. It's a big number (we know 😅), but we can confidently say: it's one of the best investments we make all year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"2-start-the-search-choose-a-location-and-outline-your-agenda\"\u003e2.

When you're planning travel for a globally distributed team, the list of dream locations can be quite lengthy!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen narrowing down potential Retreat locations, we like to start with the \u003cem\u003evibe\u003c/em\u003e we're going for. Are we dreaming of a relaxed, beachy escape where teammates can take walking 1:1s on the sand? Or a lively city Retreat packed with cultural experiences and buzzy energy? Clarifying the style of event helps narrow the options quickly and keeps your goals front and center.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince we prioritize all-inclusive properties and weather that allows for outdoor events, we’ve landed at coastal or beachy locations over the last few years. However, if we can find city properties that meet our non-negotiables and wishlist items, we’d love to rotate the vibe for Buffer Retreats.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom there, we also consider factors like flight costs and travel time (long travel days can zap energy fast, but are often unavoidable for global teams), and whether the destination offers a new experience — something culturally or geographically different from past Retreats. Language is another consideration. While English-speaking countries are often the easiest, we've found it incredibly helpful to choose places where at least one teammate speaks the local language or where we can plan for extra support.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"schedule-for-the-week\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSchedule for the week\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eNext up, you'll want to start thinking about your ideal \u003cem\u003eweek-of\u003c/em\u003e flow; this will help guide your property search!

These are helpful for us to keep top of mind and plan around when we are designing the schedule. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese are the events we include at every Retreat:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWelcome event: hugs and warm fuzzies as we reunite and/or meet each other.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCultural introduction to the country or area: If we have a teammate from the country, we love to hear from them, and if not, ask someone at the resort if they'd be willing to share about the local culture.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eKeynote from our CEO, \u003ca href=\"https://joel.is/\"\u003eJoel Gascoigne\u003c/a\u003e: Generally Monday morning or day 1, as this helps kick off the week.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTeam-wide customer support session: Everyone in the inbox supporting our customers, together.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePersonal story groups: Small groups that share their personal story (story of their life, essentially) over dinner a few nights a week. This helps deepen the relationship with teammates outside of your direct team, and it is often a favorite activity for Bufferoos. In our post-retreat survey, one teammate wrote, “Personal stories were my favorite part of the event! It was such a special experience to connect with my group on a deeper level.”\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFull Team Dinner: Mid-week event to connect and bond\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGratitude session: Team-wide time to close out the week by leaning into our value to “Show Gratitude,” while we pass a microphone and share things we’re thankful for, about Buffer, the week together, and beyond.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn our experience, teammates appreciate the structured agenda. This also came up in our post-retreat survey with one Bufferoo specifically mentioning, “I honestly loved every moment of the event. Nothing felt unnecessary or unplanned. I felt like everything was well thought out and prepared.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTeam events we like to consider\u003c/strong\u003e (if budget, property, and timeline allow):\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eFarewell dinner: a final event to gather, say goodbye (hugging that many people takes time!), and wish each other safe travels.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eKaraoke: a fun and easy way to delight the team and let loose together. Many tenured teammates might say it's a Buffer staple!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFull team or team offsite activities: if budget allows, it's fun to see the area we've traveled to or do something fun outside of the resort as a team (optional).\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"planning-partners\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlanning partners\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother big decision early on is whether to bring in a \u003cstrong\u003eplanning partner\u003c/strong\u003e. If you're working with a small team or just want to reduce stress, a partner can be a huge asset. At Buffer, we like to stay pretty hands-on, but we've found a helpful balance between what we own and what we outsource.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat we outsource:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe love getting help with sourcing locations, booking the property, and finding additional vendors like ground transportation or activity providers. One of the biggest perks we’ve found is that planning partners often have direct relationships with hotel brands and can escalate issues quickly when needed. During team travel days, planning partners can sometimes also offer remote support from alternate time zones, which makes a big difference and allows the planning team to travel and rest a bit more easily.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat we own:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat said, we like to own the heart of the planning ourselves. We set the vision, stay closely involved in vendor selection, and manage swag, team communication, and on-the-ground coordination during the week. The magic really happens when you find a partner who gets your working style and vision. Ideally, each Retreat gets easier as they get to know your team and your preferences a little better. ✨\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"3-create-cultural-connections-moments-that-bring-the-team-closer\"\u003e3. Create cultural connections: Moments that bring the team closer\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the biggest reasons we host Retreats at Buffer is to nurture cultural connection, and not just with the country we're visiting, but with each other. While a lot of that magic happens organically, we also love to build in a few intentional moments that spark connection, especially across teams that don't often work together day to day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur schedule already includes a few meaningful highlights, like a cultural introduction to the country, personal story dinners, and our gratitude session. But we also love layering in some extra fun:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRetreats:\u003c/strong\u003e This beloved Buffer tradition turns into a global snack fest in the best way. Teammates are invited to bring goodies from their area. Think local candies, coffee, teas, or whatever their hometown is famous for, and share them with the team. The table (actually… \u003cem\u003etables\u003c/em\u003e, plural) quickly becomes a 24-foot buffet (no joke!) of treats and conversation starters. It's delightful, delicious, and an easy way to get a literal taste of each other's worlds.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cblockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJCTmwKo-Pc/?utm_source=ig_embed\u0026amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Arrange transportation: Coordinate flights, arrivals, and ground logistics\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBetween flights, airport pickups, and jet-lagged teammates arriving from all corners of the globe, transportation is one of the most important (and underestimated!) parts of Retreat planning.

You'll want to align on budgets, the expense process, and timing, especially if flight costs will hit in the same billing cycle. At Buffer, most of our team prefers to book their own flights (seasoned travelers over here!), and we've found it to be more efficient than working through a booking service.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe typically offer a budget cap based on researched averages from major departure cities, padded a bit to cover seat selection and taxes. We cover economy fares that allow seat selection for long-haul flights and haven't required cancellation coverage in the past, though it's worth evaluating the cost impact and including if your budget allows! Giving teammates a clear booking timeline helps get things rolling, even if not everyone books right away. Just don't forget to clearly outline how to expense flights or use the company card, it's a small detail that saves a lot of back-and-forth later.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-blue\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-callout-emoji\"\u003e💡\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-callout-text\"\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003ePro tip:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/b\u003e For teammates checking bags, we recommend an AirTag within the bag.

We aim for a simple, supportive experience where teammates can walk off the plane, spot the Buffer sign, and hop into a clean, safe ride. If you're working with a planning partner, lean on them to source vendors (bonus points if they've worked with them before). For us, clear communication in English, professional drivers, clean vehicles, and reliable arrival tracking are key.

Even if they're tentative, early notice increases the chance that more teammates can attend.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom there, we keep everything centralized in transparent Slack channels:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ea planning channel, for the core planning team to coordinate for months in advance and through the event itself.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ea dedicated support channel, for any and all questions that teammates have as they plan, book flights, pack, travel, and submit expenses.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ea photo channel to collect all of the special memories and moments in real time.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ea chatter channel for anything and everything (cue spontaneous pool meetups!)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese channels start buzzing early (like when flights open up) and carry through the entire week on-site.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe also launch our Retreat resource and agenda well in advance, even if it's still a work in progress. Let the team know that changes will happen, but having a shared doc early on helps everyone follow along and get in the Retreat mindset.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, we love carving out time during monthly All Hands to walk through key Retreat details and host a live Q\u0026amp;A. It gives teammates space to ask questions, share ideas, or just get hyped.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-blue\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-callout-emoji\"\u003e🖊️\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-callout-text\"\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003eTL;DR:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/b\u003e \u003ci\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cstrong class=\"italic\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003eOver-communicate\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/i\u003e.

We also use this time to set up our main session area with gratitude and Retreats stations, a first-aid station, journals/pens, pack swag bags, and test tech. Setting up a welcome table with nametags and welcome signage makes a huge difference in creating a welcoming first impression.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce teammates start arriving, your phone becomes your lifeline. Keep it charged and be ready to field transportation updates, coordinate arrivals, or handle hotel questions (we recommend WhatsApp groups for vendor communication). You'll also want to arrive early for any team events or sessions to do one last check of the space.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd while you're moving behind the scenes to make it all happen, \u003cstrong\u003edon't forget to give yourself some grace\u003c/strong\u003e.

But because I started my career right before the world shut down, I never had a chance to build the kind of in-person networking muscle that so many professionals talk about.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor years, my version of “connecting” meant DMs, Zoom calls, and Slack channels.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo this year, I decided to change that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI set a personal goal to attend three conferences in 2025. Not just to learn new things, but to finally experience what it’s like to be in a space full of ideas, energy, and people I could learn from face-to-face.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks to Buffer’s \u003ca href=\"https://buffer.com/resources/growth-mindset-fund/\"\u003eGrowth Mindset\u003c/a\u003e and Conference funds, I was able to kick things off at SXSW London — my first international, in-person conference.\\\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/2025/07/First-International-Conference.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"3555\" srcset=\"https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/size/w600/2025/07/First-International-Conference.jpeg 600w, https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/size/w1000/2025/07/First-International-Conference.jpeg 1000w, https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/size/w1600/2025/07/First-International-Conference.jpeg 1600w, https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/2025/07/First-International-Conference.jpeg 2066w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn this post, I’ll share how I made it happen, what surprised me the most, and what I’d do differently next time. If you’ve been thinking about attending your first conference too, this might be the nudge you need.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"why-i-wanted-to-attend-in-person-conferences\"\u003eWhy I wanted to attend in-person conferences\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’ve always loved learning (not school, \u003cem\u003elearning\u003c/em\u003e) — it’s one of the reasons I ended up in content marketing. But after four years of remote work, I realized I’d only been investing in \u003cem\u003eone\u003c/em\u003e kind of growth: the kind that happens behind a screen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile that’s valuable, something was missing. I’d never really learned how to network in person — how to spark conversation during a coffee break, walk up to a speaker after a panel, or build relationships outside of scheduled Zoom calls. Starting my career just before the pandemic meant I skipped the phase where many professionals figure that out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t just about networking, either. I wanted to be in spaces where ideas were being created and shared \u003cem\u003elive\u003c/em\u003e. I wanted to meet new people, and to stretch myself outside of the structured (and often safe) world of remote routines.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo at the start of 2025, I made a promise to myself: I’d attend at least one conference this year. Not just to listen and learn, but to build a new muscle — one that could help me grow professionally and personally in ways online spaces couldn’t fully replicate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"how-i-made-it-happen\"\u003eHow I made it happen\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the biggest reasons I was able to follow through on this goal was support from Buffer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe have two internal resources that made a huge difference: the \u003cstrong\u003eGrowth Mindset fund\u003c/strong\u003e, which helps team members invest in personal learning and development, and the \u003cstrong\u003eConference fund\u003c/strong\u003e, which covers the cost of attending events that align with our work and brand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI decided to use both and SXSW London felt like the perfect place to start — a mix of tech, creativity, and culture, all in a city I love visiting. It was equal parts intimidating and exciting, which felt like the right energy to kick off this journey.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Growth Mindset fund for 2024 (up to $1,000) covered my \u003cstrong\u003eSXSW London Conference Pass\u003c/strong\u003e — which, if you’ve looked into SXSW before, you know isn’t cheap. Then, I used my funds for 2025 for the plane ticket, covering accommodation and other aspects of the trip myself. Knowing the most significant cost was taken care of gave me the push I needed to commit. No more just bookmarking events and telling myself, “maybe next year.” This year, it was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo make the most of it, I created content that would offer value to Buffer’s audience: two blog posts (including this one), an Instagram Stories takeover during the event, and a short-form video shared across our Threads, Instagram, and LinkedIn.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/2025/07/First-International-Conference--1-.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"3555\" srcset=\"https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/size/w600/2025/07/First-International-Conference--1-.jpeg 600w, https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/size/w1000/2025/07/First-International-Conference--1-.jpeg 1000w, https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/size/w1600/2025/07/First-International-Conference--1-.jpeg 1600w, https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/2025/07/First-International-Conference--1-.jpeg 2066w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf your team offers any kind of learning budget, this might be a good way to use it!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"conference-tips-from-a-first-timer\"\u003eConference tips from a first-timer\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause this was my first in-person conference, I didn’t want to just show up and hope for the best — I needed a bit of a game plan. Here are a few things that made the experience smoother, more enjoyable, and a lot less overwhelming:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFind a reliable way to take notes.\u003c/strong\u003e I used \u003ca href=\"https://www.superwhisper.com/\"\u003eSuperwhisper\u003c/a\u003e, which records and transcribes audio in real time. It let me stay present during panels without stressing about missing important points — and it made writing this post (and others) much easier.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDon’t try to attend everything.\u003c/strong\u003e I made a shortlist of must-see sessions that aligned with my work at Buffer and goals as a creator using the SXSW London app, while leaving space for spontaneous decisions and time to recharge. That balance made a big difference.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePrepare a few conversation starters.\u003c/strong\u003e As an introvert, the idea of networking made me nervous — but having simple things to say (“What sessions have you enjoyed so far?” or even just “This is my first conference!”) helped break the ice.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAllow yourself to step away.\u003c/strong\u003e Not every moment needs to be maximized. Some of the best insights came from moments of pause — walking, reflecting, or just letting the experience sink in.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/2025/07/First-International-Conference--2-.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"3555\" srcset=\"https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/size/w600/2025/07/First-International-Conference--2-.jpeg 600w, https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/size/w1000/2025/07/First-International-Conference--2-.jpeg 1000w, https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/size/w1600/2025/07/First-International-Conference--2-.jpeg 1600w, https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/2025/07/First-International-Conference--2-.jpeg 2066w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eA few other notes are more for comfort while navigating the area the conference is set in: research the transport system and check the weather app beforehand. It will save you from getting your passport wet (spoken from experience).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, one small thing that made a big difference: I wore something I felt confident in. It sounds trivial, but it gave me a tiny mental edge walking into rooms where I didn’t know anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"what-i-learned-beyond-the-sessions\"\u003eWhat I learned (beyond the sessions)\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe panels were great — insightful, thought-provoking, and sometimes even surprising. But the biggest things I took away from SXSW London didn’t come from the stage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey came from everything in between.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI learned that people are \u003cem\u003efar\u003c/em\u003e more generous in person than I expected. There’s something about being in the same physical space that makes it easier to connect — not just professionally, but human-to-human. Whether it was a quick chat in line for coffee (which happened a lot) or a longer conversation after a panel, those moments felt lighter, easier, and somehow more impactful than most of my scheduled online calls.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI also realized that energy really matters. Online, it’s easy to multitask, zone out, or treat content passively. But being in the room — hearing a speaker’s tone, seeing others react, asking questions live — changes the way you absorb information. It sticks differently. After years of passively watching webinars in the background, it was refreshing to give a speaker my full attention.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother thing I didn’t expect: creating content \u003cem\u003ewhile\u003c/em\u003e attending helped me engage more deeply. Knowing I’d be sharing takeaways with Buffer’s audience made me listen with intention. I wasn’t just consuming — I was filtering, analyzing, thinking, “How could this help someone else?” That mindset shift made the whole experience more interactive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat said, working while attending wasn’t easy. I had to pace myself — balancing learning, networking, and capturing content took more energy than I anticipated. But in the end, it helped me leave the conference with both personal insights \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e something valuable to share with others.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"my-conference-content-approach\"\u003eMy conference content approach\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom the start, I knew I wanted to get more than a list of notes out of the conference — I wanted to turn the experience into content that would be useful to others, especially the Buffer audience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat started with the \u003cstrong\u003eInstagram Stories takeover\u003c/strong\u003e on Buffer’s account. I kept it simple and real-time: short videos, quick reflections between sessions, and little moments that brought the energy of SXSW London to anyone watching from home. I didn’t try to be overly polished — just present. That felt more aligned with how I naturally show up online, and honestly, it made the process way more enjoyable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNext, I took all the notes and Superwhisper transcripts from the panels and started organizing themes. There were clear threads — creator monetization, AI tools, business sustainability, and more — and I used those to draft a second blog post focused on tactical takeaways from the sessions I attended. That piece is for anyone who didn’t get to go but still wants the value.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-blue\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-callout-emoji\"\u003e📚\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-callout-text\"\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003eRead: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://buffer.com/resources/insights-for-creators-from-sxsw-london/\"\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003eAI Won’t Take Your Job –\u0026nbsp;But It Will Change How You Do It (+ 5 More Insights for Creators from SXSW London)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis post — the one you’re reading now — is the \u003cem\u003eother\u003c/em\u003e side of that coin.

Absolutely.\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore SXSW London, I wasn’t sure how I’d feel after my first in-person conference. Would it feel worth it? Would I feel out of place? Would the benefits outweigh the exhaustion?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow I can confidently say: I’d do it again in a heartbeat.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn fact, I \u003cem\u003eam\u003c/em\u003e doing it again. I’m planning to attend one more conference this year — and this time, I have a much clearer sense of what I need to thrive. I know how to pace myself, which tools make the experience smoother, and I now know to always check the weather app before I leave my hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut more than that, I now see conferences not as isolated events, but as momentum-builders. They shake up your usual rhythm, re-energize your work, and remind you that professional growth doesn’t only happen behind a screen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s still a lot I’m figuring out — like how to keep up the connections I made and how to follow up meaningfully without burning out. But this first step changed the way I think about my own career path, and gave me proof that I can belong in rooms I used to only watch from afar.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’ve been thinking about going to a conference but keep pushing it off — take this as your sign.\u003c/p\u003e",

The example I’ll dig into today is our “Dependent Grant,” which we \u003ca href=\"https://buffer.com/resources/dependents/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"\u003elaunched in 2016\u003c/a\u003e.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur Dependent Grant is separate benefit, outside of salary, that we grant teammates who are taking care of and supporting family members. It’s an extra $3,000 USD per year per child, up to four dependents total. This has been one of our most unusual (and at times controversial) benefits.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUntil recently, this was granted for extended family members, like siblings, parents, and grandparents. After eight years, we’ve updated this benefit. As always, we’re here to share the full story. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"our-new-dependent-stipend-in-2025\"\u003eOur new Dependent Stipend in 2025\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eStarting this year, we’ve decided to apply our stipend to \u003cstrong\u003edependent children\u003c/strong\u003e,\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eand no longer\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003einclude partners or extended family members. It’s still a priority to support our teammates with young kiddos, especially during those rare weeks of work-related travel, such as\u003ca href=\"https://buffer.com/resources/retreat/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"\u003e \u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://buffer.com/resources/retreat/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"\u003eRetreat week\u003c/a\u003e.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe dependent stipend will continue to be a pillar in our network of benefits designed to help our team thrive in our remote work experience. For example, teammates often apply this stipend to childcare such as daycare or a nanny, which allows them to work during the day. To quote from a teammate in the original discussion: “s\u003cem\u003eupporting dependent children has a unique and direct impact on how Buffer teammates can engage with their work.” \u003c/em\u003eThe goal was to strike this exact balance: generosity and support for teammates \u003cem\u003eas it relates to work and our business\u003c/em\u003e.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBeyond that, we feel it’s a family choice how a teammate’s family approaches work, childcare, and extended familial support. If we had unlimited profits, we’d love to support every teammate in a variety of different financial situations, and in fact this was the original dream of this stipend back almost 10 years ago! However, as a small business, we have to continually find the right balance of generosity and pragmatism when we examine our budget, our priorities, and our choices.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is how we will now define a Dependent:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eUnder 18 years of age\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eResiding in the Buffer teammate’s home at least some of the time\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe Buffer teammate is one of their primary caregivers\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAll other situations on a case-by-case basis\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis adjustment ensures that the stipend is focused on supporting childcare-related needs, bolstering our commitment to helping teammates thrive in a remote work environment. Whether it’s offsetting childcare costs during work hours or easing the burden during work travel (like retreat weeks), this stipend is now focused on offering practical support to teammates with young families.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnder the new structure, we have \u003cstrong\u003e59 dependents across 31 teammates\u003c/strong\u003e who are receiving support, with a projected budget of \u003cstrong\u003e$117,000 for the year \u003c/strong\u003e— a number that will likely grow as we welcome new Buffer babies or hire teammates with dependents throughout 2025.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen we reevaluated the benefit in 2024, Buffer was supporting 99 dependents, including:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e59 children\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e22 spouses/partners\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e15 parents\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e2 siblings\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e1 grandparent\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt $3,000 per dependent, this amounted to a total of $297,000 per year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo be clear, while we know this topic has financial implications, our deep dive into the dependent stipend was driven more by the commitment to transparency and fairness. For example, transparency is lacking on this topic; this stipend is not included in \u003ca href=\"https://buffer.com/salaries\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"\u003eour public salaries\u003c/a\u003e, and the concept of a dependent was being applied differently across the team.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"why-we-changed-our-dependent-stipend\"\u003eWhy we changed our Dependent Stipend\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eLate in 2024, we held a “Leadership Collaboration Week“, focused on taking a step back from the day-to-day business and asking bigger questions on our strategy, culture, or execution.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI brought up our Dependent Stipend, and many teammates chimed in to unpack the cultural and financial implications of offering this benefit. (As with all topics that relate to money, not everyone has the same perspective, but I loved that we were able to have a really open discussion about the topic.)\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s a summary of some elements of the stipend that work well for the Buffer team:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe love the idea of supporting working parents. In general, modern capitalism forces parents to make tough tradeoffs between work and family, and we want to help make those tradeoffs a little bit easier. (This is one motivation behind our four-day workweek as well.)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBecause we’re fully remote, we periodically ask teammates to travel to a central location for coworking and bonding. When parents travel for work, it requires a lot of preparation and support, some of which incurs additional costs, especially related to childcare.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe try to be generous with teammates, and we loved getting to support teammates who were helping out a family member going through a tough time and not able to work.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe are a US-based company, but we have teammates all over the world. This level of generosity supported a variety of global cultures, some of which have more family-sharing than others.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, here are the elements that felt a bit off about the stipend:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe are meticulous about fairness and transparency when it comes to our \u003ca href=\"https://buffer.com/resources/salary-system/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"\u003esalary formula\u003c/a\u003e. This fund is separate from salary, and because we took a “no-questions-asked” approach, we ended up with some big disparities in how this was applied across the team, which felt out of line with our approach to overall compensation and benefits.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt felt a bit off to give extra money to teammates whose spouses and partners chose not to work in contrast to those partners who did. I often found myself twisted into logic puzzles on this one. For example, a family with an at-home parent often did not pay for external childcare, but these were the teammates whose spouses were eligible for the grant. (Of course, the grant is \u003cem\u003emuch\u003c/em\u003e less than childcare costs in a year in most places, but still.)\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe reflected on these elements and how we felt about them in light of Buffer’s \u003ca href=\"https://buffer.com/about#values\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"\u003eValues\u003c/a\u003e and our compensation philosophy (which is to strive to be transparent, fair, generous, and simple), and ended up with a new version of this grant for the future.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"over-to-you\"\u003eOver to you!\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen this benefit was first introduced in 2018, each Buffer teammate claimed an average of 1.04 dependents. By 2020, that number had increased to 1.2 dependents per teammate. In 2024, it had risen further to 1.35 dependents per teammate — a reflection of how our team’s lives and responsibilities have evolved over time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of Buffer’s core \u003ca href=\"https://buffer.com/shareholders/2023\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOperating Principles\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e is to prioritize long-term thinking — building a company that thrives for decades, embracing patient growth, and planning ahead for our industry and the world. This principle extends to our team as well: 54% of our current teammates have been with Buffer for five years or longer. As they’ve grown with us, so have the caregiving responsibilities for many who have welcomed children while at Buffer. Our dependent stipend has been a reflection of this commitment, evolving alongside our team to provide meaningful support at different stages of life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs always, we’d love to hear your thoughts.

Finding someone who will thrive in our work environment, and is also highly skilled in the areas we’re hiring for, can be tough.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo in a recent hiring round, we decided to try something new.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI asked a candidate who was in the final stages of interviewing to spend a full day working with us across Zoom and Slack. They would be working on real projects relevant to the role, and they’d get a chance to work alongside the rest of their potential future team.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy hope was that this day of working together would give the hiring team a clearer picture of how the candidate works, communicates, and collaborates.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo my delight, the candidate was thrilled to participate! And, of course, we paid them for their time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRead on for more details and what we learned for next time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"why-we-decided-to-try-a-full-day-of-collaborating\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy we decided to try a full day of collaborating\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eOver the years we’ve refined our application process and it’s been fairly successful for us. We ask pretty non-standard questions — things like, “Tell us about something - anything - you’re passionate about” —that help us get a feel for who a person is.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’ve always appreciated that we aren’t \u003cem\u003eonly\u003c/em\u003e asking about work experience given that we’re looking for true value-alignment with the rest of the Buffer team. I realize this is a high bar, but it also creates a high-trust environment when we are all truly operating from the same place and energized by the same mission.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut even with multiple hiring rounds, it can be hard to get to know how someone is going to show up at work and collaborate with the rest of the team. It is one thing to say you value transparency in an interview, and another to truly work transparently with your team.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’ve also done take-home assignments as well. I know this is a contentious topic — but my opinion is you just need to see someone’s work in many roles, especially senior ones.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTake-home assignments have frequently helped us spot who might be the best fit early on. Out of respect for candidates’ time, I always keep them brief — but taking the middle ground here means that there are limits on how much you get to see of someone’s work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe other factor, of course, is AI. Our applications tend to be writing heavy, and having solid written communication is important to us as that’s the main way we speak and work with each other. In the age of AI, we found a huge number of applications where it was clear the candidate used AI exclusively to answer questions. In other cases, it can be hard to determine what is human and genuine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis most recent hiring round was a perfect opportunity to try something new. I was in the unique position of bringing a candidate in to interview with us who had been a finalist in another hiring round. I didn’t want to put this candidate through our whole hiring process again — they had already been through those stages — but of course, it felt important to get to know this person better since it had been a few months.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur Chief of Staff, \u003ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/carolynkopprasch/\"\u003eCaro Kopprasch\u003c/a\u003e, has been keen to shake things up with our hiring process, due to the challenges mentioned above with AI, and the gaps between interviewing and a full-time role. We brainstormed a small experiment (based on lessons learned from our collective 20+ years doing hiring at Buffer!).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe decided to spend the day working together with the candidate in Slack to get a real feel for how this person would truly collaborate.

I find one of the most fun parts of hiring is getting to know people and daydreaming about how well that person would work on the team and propel projects. Collaboration Day made those dreams come true!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst of all, as I mentioned — this was a paid interview. We paid the candidate $400 for the full day, and we plan to pay all future candidates the same for a full day to keep it fair. The candidate took a day off of work, and on our side, we set aside a lot of time so that we could focus on collaborating.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI planned out the structure of the day to include two main projects, and I let the candidate know what they were in advance. From there, I invited the candidate to a Slack channel set up specifically for this purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI wanted the day to balance live brainstorming calls with working in docs, having conversations in comments, and coordinating back-and-forth in Slack. This was a tough balance, and there was a lot to fit in. In hindsight, I could have likely kept it to just one project.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was a very full day, and it went by faster than expected. We had an initial call to say hi and do our first live brainstorm together, and we also did a call to close out the day, hear how it all felt, and chat next steps.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom our side, it went incredibly well. Four people from the hiring team got way more overlap with this candidate, saw how they worked, collaborated, asked questions, shared ideas, and executed on ideas and projects. When we were reflecting on how the day went, we all had so much more context around what areas we felt solid and where we would want to ask more questions and get clarity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter Collaboration Day, this candidate was moved to the final interview that all candidates have before they potentially receive an offer — an interview with our CEO, \u003ca href=\"https://joel.is/\"\u003eJoel Gascoigne\u003c/a\u003e, and our Chief of Staff, Caro Kopprasch.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"what-we-learned-for-next-time\"\u003eWhat we learned for next time\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, this first iteration was a success. On the practical side, I would definitely scale back to one project in the future to ensure there’s enough time to make meaningful progress, and also to allow for a lot of time in Slack or other written tools, since that was one of the main areas we wanted to assess.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUltimately, what we learned is that having a full day of collaboration with a potential candidate was a fun and effective way to assess how someone collaborates. It made us feel extra confident when we reached the offer stage that we were making the right decision.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo sneak in some extra fun news right at the end — this candidate received an offer, and accepted! We can’t wait to share more about this new Buffer teammate soon. 😊 🎉\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLeave a comment below with any questions you have about this process and we’ll share more details. ⬇️\u003c/p\u003e",

While we ended the year with over $200,000 in net profit, this journey wasn't a straight line. We entered 2024 with monthly losses, including our highest expense month in March with a loss of over $250,000; largely resulting from the costs of our company retreat. What followed was remarkable: nine consecutive months of profitability, steadily clawing our way back to break even and then profit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-01-27-at-3.49.34-PM.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1063\" srcset=\"https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-01-27-at-3.49.34-PM.png 600w, https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-01-27-at-3.49.34-PM.png 1000w, https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/size/w1600/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-01-27-at-3.49.34-PM.png 1600w, https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-01-27-at-3.49.34-PM.png 2112w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat's particularly noteworthy is that the bulk of our profitability was achieved in the final two months of the year. The first ten months essentially balanced out to break even, but then November and December each brought in over $100,000 in profit, pushing us to that final $200,000 figure for the year. This gives us a strong indication of what 2025 might look like, starting the year with this kind of monthly profitability as our baseline.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch1 id=\"why-profitability-matters-at-buffer\"\u003eWhy profitability matters at Buffer\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cp\u003eBeing profitable is really a fundamental part of what I like to call being a \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/strong-words/real-businesses-b21f44c99b6a\"\u003e“real business”\u003c/a\u003e - a term I first heard from \u003ca href=\"https://bryce.vc/\"\u003eBryce\u003c/a\u003e of \u003ca href=\"https://www.indie.vc/\"\u003eindie.vc\u003c/a\u003e. For Buffer, choosing to operate long-term means dealing with all aspects of actually making the business run. Without relying on funding (which is generally the approach for tech businesses), we need to be profitable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis profitability is vital for us to maintain our independence long-term, especially when we want to have equity and stock options working in the mix of things and provide liquidity through buybacks. But beyond the practical aspects, profitability gives us conviction and helps us to be really ambitious about our future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch1 id=\"the-philosophy-behind-profit-sharing\"\u003eThe philosophy behind profit sharing\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’ve carried out profit sharing at Buffer\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://buffer.com/resources/q4-2017/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003esince 2017\u003c/a\u003e, and we see it as a component of building a long-term, sustainable, thriving business. We’ve issued profit share bonuses five times since then, however, the past two years were exceptions with no profit share bonuses as we did not achieve profitability.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI deeply believe that as we grow Buffer together as a team, we should collectively benefit. Specifically, all of us working day in, day out, week in, week out, should be benefiting from the success we create together. This stands in contrast to the typical tech company model where investors, who often put in the least time and energy, benefit the most.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch1 id=\"how-our-2024-profit-share-works\"\u003eHow our 2024 profit share works\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor 2024, we distributed 15% of our net profit as profit share bonuses. This is higher than our historical range of 8-12%, reflecting both the exceptional year we've had and our move toward a more consistent approach for the future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe distribution model is designed to incorporate different factors of our collective success:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e40% of the pool is distributed equally across the team, representing that this was truly a team effort\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e40% is distributed weighted by salary, reflecting the different levels of responsibility and impact we can have in our roles\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e20% is weighted by tenure at the company, acknowledging the value of long-term commitment and historical context\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-01-27-at-3.52.10-PM.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"590\" srcset=\"https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-01-27-at-3.52.10-PM.png 600w, https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-01-27-at-3.52.10-PM.png 1000w, https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/size/w1600/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-01-27-at-3.52.10-PM.png 1600w, https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-01-27-at-3.52.10-PM.png 2096w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith our $202,459 in net profit, this created a profit share pool of just over $30,000, distributed among our 73 team members.

We kicked off this \u003ca href=\"https://buffer.com/resources/closing/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"\u003eat the end of 2016\u003c/a\u003e and have kept up every year since then.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eClosing down for the last week of the year is an opportunity to pause and recharge. It’s like a reset, except across the whole company. I love telling people about this practice at Buffer because they have so many questions about how we continue to operate while closing down for a week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs we work with many small businesses and creators who can sometimes struggle with working over the holidays, it feels especially important to share how we’re going about this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo in this post, I’ll cover what it means to close down for a week as a business whose customers are always using it, why we do it, and specifically how our largest teams manage this time off while still caring for our product and our customers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet’s dive in!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"what-does-it-mean-to-close-down-for-a-week\"\u003eWhat does it mean to close down for a week?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the end of every year, we close down for the year's final week. The exact definition of “closed down” varies from company to company – some businesses will completely shut down operations while others will only close particular sections of their business.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis gives everyone at the company some extra time to rest, and it creates an environment where no one is worried about missing out on projects or updates while they’re offline because we’re all offline. We’ve done this sort of thing before, closing down for an extra long weekend in the summer, and it’s always been refreshing for our team.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I say that we’re closed, that means that most of the company is off (I’ll elaborate in the next section), we aren’t releasing new features or changing our product at all, we aren’t publishing new blog posts, and it is intentionally a time of rest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn our business, creating tools for small businesses and creators building a brand online, this time of year is also reliably slow. So unlike some other industries that may pick up over the holidays, we can lean into rest by closing the company during a naturally slower period.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"what-does-this-look-like-in-practice\"\u003eWhat does this look like in practice?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor most teams at Buffer, closing for the holidays means a full disconnect. Our two largest teams, Engineering and Customer Advocacy have to create systems where we can still serve our customers and ensure Buffer is operational while also making space for additional rest. So here’s how Engineering and Advocacy tackle the week off.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"how-our-advocacy-team-handles-a-week-closed\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow our Advocacy team handles a week closed\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur Advocacy team is a group of absolute pros who are taking care of our customers. This year, they’ve helped solve over 50,000 customer support requests and sent over 105,000 replies with an average first response time of just four hours, 38 minutes (business hours).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years that we have been closing, they have figured out the right balance to ensure we can still help customers while also giving our Advocates that extra rest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo start, we take steps to make this period visible to our customers. They post a clear message stating that we’re shut down for the holidays in all the main channels where we communicate with customers. Those include a banner for people who are in Buffer, an auto-reply to customer support email, a pinned tweet on our account, and several other places.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis year, the message reads:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Buffer team is observing a company-wide holiday shutdown from 25 December to 1 January. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhile our response times will be a little slower than usual, a dedicated crew of Customer Advocates are working as quickly as possible to respond to customer messages. Happy Holidays ✨\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEach Advocate is working one full day or two half days. We stagger our coverage across the close down period to ensure we have the optimal number of people online on the days we expect to be busiest. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis year we have people online on Dec 24, we have a few hours of coverage on Dec 25, and we have people online on Jan 1. We ask all Advocates to work full weeks (five days) in the two weeks following the holiday period to ensure we kick off the new year with the inbox in great shape and customers being helped as quickly as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe team has in place a clear schedule, expectations when people are online with how to prioritize their work and get back to customers, and guidelines for emergencies. (We have those guidelines in place all the time, but it’s always good to review ahead of the holidays.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"how-our-engineering-team-handles-a-week-closed\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow our Engineering team handles a week closed\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eSimilar to Advocacy, for our engineers, we need to have some coverage of engineers who are on call in case something happens.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor Engineering, their break looks different because they are on call, meaning they are available if something breaks, rather than fully online during this time. That means that the load of being on call can be spread among fewer people because the likelihood of them needing to be online is lower.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe way that the on-call schedule works is that there are several specialized or senior members of the team who are immediately placed in all of the on-call spots. Then we ask for volunteers from the rest of the engineering team to be on-call throughout the week.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"a-few-questions-from-our-community-about-closing-down-for-a-week\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA few questions from our community about closing down for a week\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe reached out on social media to see what questions people had about closing down for a week, and we got a few good questions. Here’s our response: \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"do-clients-find-this-frustrating-or-ever-complain\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo clients find this frustrating or ever complain?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe haven’t heard major complaints or frustration about this in the past, and if ever things have not gone as planned, we’ve adjusted our plan for the following year. We make sure to be very transparent that we’re taking this time off across our communication channels. We still have our Advocacy team spending some time online and can reply to anything urgent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"did-this-impact-your-bottom-line-at-all\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDid this impact your bottom line at all?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eNo, we intentionally choose a slow time for us to be closed. So it’s the right time to take a break without any major impact. In addition, since the Advocacy team is still monitoring for urgent customer requests and the Engineering team is on call, we can still jump on any issues that pop up, and our customers still have support.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"i%E2%80%99d-love-to-know-about-the-benefits-your-company-has-seen-and-how-it-positively-impacts-employees\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI’d love to know about the benefits your company has seen and how it positively impacts employees!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe biggest benefit we’ve seen from closing down for the holidays is that our team is more rested and refreshed. It’s a unique opportunity for everyone at Buffer to take a break, rather than it happening in spots throughout the year. It means the energy levels in the first few weeks of the year are always really high for us. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTaking this week off for all of us at once also gives us a greater opportunity to relax because no one needs to think about projects that are moving forward without them or missing out on team communication. After all, we’re all offline. This is great for us as a team, which translates into being great for our product and our customers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr\u003e\u003cp\u003eDo you take breaks from work or your business, and if so, what’s your approach?

We’ve recently been focused on modernizing all parts of Buffer, which we talked about a little when we released \u003ca href=\"https://buffer.com/resources/salary-system/\"\u003eour new salary system\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePart of modernizing has been reflecting and taking a critical look at our current product. In a recent transparent discussion that was open to the whole team, we decided that some of the free tools we’d created long ago were no longer a priority for our product strategy and, as they were quite outdated, would be a huge investment to bring into 2024.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith that, \u003cstrong\u003ewe've decided to sunset three of our free tools: Pablo, Stories Creator, and Remix, as of November 10th, 2024.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s a little more about that decision and what it means for you if you use these tools.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"why-we-chose-to-sunset-these-tools\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy we chose to sunset these tools\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll of these tools are projects that our team hasn’t worked on for many, many years. Without attention from our team, we also saw interest in these tools diminishing. Very few people ever load Stories Creator and both Pablo and Remix have seen a downwards trend in traffic and downloads month-over-month. This could be seen in two ways — we aren’t promoting the tools since they are out of date, but we’re also not working on the tools actively in a way that would increase their use.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen we took the chance to reflect, our founder and CEO, \u003ca href=\"https://joel.start.page/\"\u003eJoel Gascoigne\u003c/a\u003e, made an excellent point:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003eThere shouldn’t be any part of the product we neglect for a long time period (say, a year). If there is, it should be a strong contender for sunsetting. If we’re not regularly removing from the product as well as adding to it, then we will inevitably have growing complexity over time which goes against our goals for simplicity and high quality.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs with any long-term endeavor, there comes a time to prune back to help streamline our efforts everywhere else. We should be doing this kind of pruning regularly, but we’ve fallen out of practice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUltimately, sunsetting these tools pushes us towards a higher standard for our work at Buffer. By simplifying our tools, we can better focus on maintaining them and keeping our bar for quality high.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese tools were also all built on older code bases, and compared to their competitors, it would take a lot of work to bring them into 2024. That level of investment into these tools just doesn’t align with our current product strategy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"looking-ahead\"\u003eLooking ahead\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile it's always difficult to say goodbye to tools that have been part of our journey, we're excited about what this means for the future of Buffer.

We want to start with an apology for not sharing more transparently along the way what’s been happening. We’ve been caught up in the work and haven’t invested enough in communicating with our community, and we’re so sorry about this misstep. We know some of our customers have had a frustrating time using Buffer recently and we need to do better by you.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis past August and September were the months we’ve experienced the most monthly incidents out of the past three years. We’re entering October in a much more stable state, but we’ve still got a lot of work planned to make our improvements long-term. \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor reference, here is \u003ca href=\"https://status.buffer.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"\u003eBuffer’s Status page\u003c/a\u003e where you can follow along with incidents and their resolution.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese issues have been, in large part, due to some of our work to modernize Buffer. We’ve been building Buffer since late 2010 and over the years we’ve accrued some technical debt. As much as we’ve been working to pay off debt in other areas of the company — we shared more about modernizing our salary system last year — we’ve been working hard to do the same on our Engineering team.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThough most of the incidents have come from us internally, we’ve also had several external incidents over the last few months from our partners having outages. Regardless of where the incident stemmed from, it added volume to our customer support inbox, led to unreliability in Buffer, and is far from the experience we want any Buffer user having.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur own work to modernize Buffer causing issues for our customers has been particularly challenging for us. We pride ourselves on building a product that helps our customers build their business and delivering a world-class customer experience.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the second quarter of this year, our Customer Advocacy team responded to 60 percent of our customers for the first time within two hours and 91 percent of our customers rated our customer support great. To put that in perspective, \u003ca href=\"https://www.jitbit.com/news/2266-average-customer-support-metrics-from-1000-companies/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"\u003eaverage customer response times \u003c/a\u003eare over seven hours. Though we are still above average, we’ve been struggling with not hitting our own bar for reliability and response times, and we want to use this post to share more about both of those. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith that, here’s what has been going on behind the scenes and what we’re doing to improve everyone’s experience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"the-current-state-of-buffer-performance-and-customer-support\"\u003eThe current state of Buffer, performance, and customer support\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs of the writing of this blog post, our team has done a ton of work to establish what has led to downtime and slowness and we’ve been feverishly working on a more stable product.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn terms of performance, we have decreased the number of incidents in September compared to August, but we still need to improve our product’s performance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"the-current-state-of-our-customer-advocacy-team\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe current state of our Customer Advocacy team\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the customer support side, we have worked hard improved our customer response time. In August, 46 percent of customers received a first response within two hours, by September, it was 59 percent. Through out this period 99 percent of our customers get a reply within 24 hours.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDue to an increase in number of customer support requests in August and added complexity due to the issues and incidents, we started September with a backlog of support requests and decided to move our Customer Advocacy team into “All Hands on Deck” for seven days. This status means that everyone dropped work outside of the inbox and moved to a five-day work week (from our usual four-day work week). With this change, we were able to get caught up on volume and significantly improve the overall customer support experience within two days.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"a-look-at-the-technical-side-from-our-engineering-team\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA look at the technical side from our Engineering team\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur Engineering team has been working to implement both immediate fixes and long-term solutions. To get into the weeds a little, here’s what the Engineering team has done and what they are actively working on to continue pursuing these performance improvements:\u003c/p\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe've rebalanced how we handle requests to our Core API based on traffic patterns.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis has significantly improved overall latency and reduced system bottlenecks. We have already seen positive results from this change in our performance metrics.\u003c/p\u003e\u003col start=\"2\"\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe've identified and are implementing fixes to make sure our database queries remain always efficient.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis includes working around a bug that was causing some queries to run much slower than expected. We're rolling this out carefully and tracking its impact to ensure it delivers the expected improvements.\u003c/p\u003e\u003col start=\"3\"\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe've been addressing issues that were causing parts of our system to become less responsive under certain conditions.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe've already fixed several instances of this issue and are continuing to identify and address others, particularly in frequently used methods like permission checks and retrieving channel information.\u003c/p\u003e\u003col start=\"4\"\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe're exploring further balancing of our API infrastructure, potentially using a larger number of smaller Kubernetes pods to distribute the load more effectively and reduce the impact of individual slowdowns.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe're implementing improved caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data, which will reduce the load on our database and improve API response times.Overall, we're approaching these changes cautiously, with a focus on both stability and performance. Each improvement is being carefully tested and rolled out gradually to ensure it doesn't introduce new issues. We're also tweaking our monitoring tools to give us more accurate insights into our system's performance, allowing us to make more informed decisions moving forward.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur team is committed to resolving these issues and providing a stable, high-performing platform. We'll continue to assess the impact of these changes and make more improvements as needed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"behind-the-scenes-what%E2%80%99s-been-going-on-for-our-team\"\u003eBehind the scenes: what’s been going on for our team\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe recent performance issues and slower response times on our customer support team has been a perfect storm of challenges. While all of this was happening, we were in one of our busiest periods, coinciding with summer holidays in the Northern Hemisphere and school vacations.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition to the usual seasonal uptick in activity, we also saw a higher volume of people signing up to use Buffer in August and September, an increase in our paying customer base, and a steady release of new features and integrations to continue our work to innovate and modernize Buffer. While these are all very positive indicators for our business, they also placed additional strain on our systems during an already busy time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSimultaneously, we've been grappling with technical issues stemming from changes happening behind the scenes. These technical challenges have manifested in various ways, affecting different aspects of the Buffer experience.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile it’s no excuse, many of these issues are linked to improvements we're making to Buffer as a whole. We're working on new features and necessary updates to improve our product, but in the process, we've encountered some hurdles that have temporarily impacted our service quality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe want to assure you that we're taking these challenges seriously and our priority is to improve our customers’ experience. Our team is working to resolve these issues while continuing to improve and expand our service. We need to do better!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"what%E2%80%99s-next\"\u003eWhat’s next?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe work doesn’t stop with these immediate fixes.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGoing forward, we're committed to continuously improving our product experience, with a key company focus on reducing customer friction. Alongside developing new features, our product and infrastructure teams always allocate significant time to evolve and enhance the existing experience and product stability.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition, our Engineering team is making several changes to continue to improve Buffer’s performances. Those include:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eImplementing a more comprehensive definition of when an incident is truly “closed.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eImproving follow-up processes internally with clear responsibilities for incident-follow ups.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eImproving processes for communicating about incidents internally and externally.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eStrengthen collaboration between our development and support teams to manage feature rollouts better and anticipate potential issues.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFinally, more accountability from our Engineering Leadership team to ensure these processes are followed and prioritizing communication.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe know this has been a challenging time for many of our customers and we’re so grateful for your patience as we improve the quality of our service.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur team is dedicated to providing you with the best possible experience, and we're keen for you all to have access to product improvements and new features we're bringing to Buffer.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe have a lot more to share on this topic so we’ll be aiming to write more blog posts and share more details about incidents in the future.

There’s a chance of “tuning out.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, delivering a stand-out customer support experience requires being diligently intentional about being present in the inbox and switching our mindset from looking at “tickets” to looking at “conversations,” as if the person was sitting right in front of us.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s a part in the book where the author talks about the “Hot Dog” story. It starts with a group of four foodies dining at his five-star restaurant on their last day of vacation in New York. The author overheard them talking about all the different restaurants they got to try on vacation. One person pipped in and mentioned, “Yeah, but the only thing we didn’t get to try was a New York hot dog.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA light bulb immediately went off in the author’s head. He ran around the corner, to the closest hot dog stand, bought a $2 hot dog, and brought it back to his five-star kitchen, and somehow he convinced the chef to serve it. The chef had spent time finessing the hot dog, cutting it into immaculate pieces, and adding a swish of ketchup and mustard. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToward the end of the four foodies' meal, he finally presented them with the hot dog dish, saying, “To make sure you don’t go home with any culinary regrets, a New York City hot dog.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd revealed the hot dog cut into four perfect pieces. The four foodies flipped out with enthusiasm and excitement. Each person said it wasn’t only the highlight of the meal, but it was the highlight of their trip to New York, and they’d be telling this story for the rest of their lives.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe author easily could’ve given the table a bottle of champagne, a more typical special experience, but the extra effort he put in made a lasting impression. \u0026nbsp;Hear the story from the author here:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bwcyXcOpWVs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"The Secret Ingredients of Great Hospitality | Will Guidara | TED\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"3-deeply-understanding-the-connection-of-our-work-how-this-impacts-our-customers\"\u003e3. Deeply understanding the connection of our work \u0026amp; how this impacts our customers\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne quote in particular from the book really stood out to us: \"When asking real estate agents what they do, many said they sold houses. But, the great ones said they were selling homes.” The great real estate agents understood the importance of their work and the value of helping people.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis highlighted how important it is for us to always keep Buffer's vision top-of-mind. Shifting our mindset from: \"I'm just helping a customer do XYZ,\" to \"I'm helping this customer or small business do good, and I’m having an impact.\" \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s a subtle shift that helps us connect our work with our higher-level vision.\u0026nbsp;Here are a few ways we do this:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBeing intentional and present in the inbox. \u003c/strong\u003eAs I explained above,\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003ewe do this by\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eswitching our mindset from looking at tickets vs. looking at the conversation as if the person was sitting in front of us.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHaving each other\u003c/strong\u003e'\u003cstrong\u003es backs as a team.\u003c/strong\u003e In the book, the author talks about how he was holding a dirty dish behind his back and how he knew in two seconds his team would help him and immediately grab the plate. Their team had a language of their own, they had signals and communicated via sign language to help each other. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTranslating that to our Advocacy team at Buffer, we’re a close-knit team of 19 close-knit spread across the globe. We have strong relationships and genuinely care about one another. We already do a great job of having each other's backs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, as we try to take our customer support to new heights, we’re asking ourselves if there are more opportunities we can be mindful of as we communicate and work virtually. For example, can we be more intentional about calling out where/how we're working? From a remote work lens, we’re exploring fresh ways we can communicate better amongst our team and leave signals and notes for each other so we can better strategize as a remote working team\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeeping an eye out for really good hospitality. \u003c/strong\u003eWe are constantly on the lookout for hospitable interactions we can learn from, whether it's at the coffee shop, auto body shop, or out to dinner. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe should be constantly thinking, \"How did this restaurant/company do it differently?\" and, \"How can we borrow and make it our own?\" We then share those stories amongst the team as inspiration.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarving out space in our syncs to praise each other publicly and share inspiration. \u003c/strong\u003eIn the book, the author mentions that they had a daily stand-up as a team, and it was an opportunity to share praise. We do several weekly stand-ups as an Advocacy team, based on time zones (East Coast, West Coast, and Europe). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe’re now working to carve out space in our weekly syncs to share praise of one another, inspiration, and share stories of great hospitable experiences we've seen recently.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"what%E2%80%99s-next-for-our-book-club-and-team\"\u003eWhat’s next for our book club and team?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eI feel like we’re just getting started! We set out with an ambition to host a book club each quarter to discuss a new book or podcast that focuses on hospitality, and we already have ideas for Q2. We’re also exploring the idea of branching out to consider books, podcasts, or TED Talks from other experts in their craft as inspiration.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a remote team spread across the world, we’re looking to better accommodate all time zones, and we’re considering hosting an “async” book club versus meeting over Zoom.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne lesson we’re taking from our first book club meeting is that it felt a bit rushed as there were SO many talking points we could chat through. We’re considering pacing ourselves — instead of reading the entire book, we could read a book in sections and digest it as a team.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first read of our book club has been immensely valuable — the idea of unreasonable hospitality is something of an ethos the team lives by now!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaya Angelou said it best, “People will forget what you said, people might forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI believe the heart of hospitality lies in that. People never forget how we make them feel. It makes me appreciate how our work in customer support really matters.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’re excited to take our learnings from the book club, and put them to work!

Since then, we’ve seen an influx of thoughts and tools around the topic and the use of AI.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe \u003cem\u003elike \u003c/em\u003eAI here at Buffer – we’ve even launched an \u003ca href=\"https://buffer.com/resources/introducing-buffers-ai-assistant/\"\u003eAI Assistant\u003c/a\u003e to help our audience create content better and faster. However, we understand its limitations, especially when it comes to creation, better than most. We also understand the (valid) concerns that many creatives and marketers have about the impact of AI on the quality of content.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo even though we use AI in our processes on Buffer’s Content team (there are only three of us, and it helps us work more efficiently), we wanted to clarify exactly \u003cem\u003ehow\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003ewhere \u003c/em\u003ewe use AI in our work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"at-a-glance-4-statements-that-explain-how-we-approach-ai-in-content\"\u003eAt a glance: 4 statements that explain how we approach AI in content\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAI assists but doesn’t replace\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAI never writes complete drafts or paragraphs without being edited by a human\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAI content is always reviewed for accuracy\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe don’t believe AI can replace creative work in any sense\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"our-history-with-ai\"\u003eOur history with AI\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’ve been playing around with different AI tools for several months, and it shows in our content archive from the past year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first article from Buffer about AI went live in May 2022 to answer the question, “\u003ca href=\"https://buffer.com/resources/ai-generated-content/\"\u003eShould you be using AI for content creation?\u003c/a\u003e” Reflecting on this article is interesting because our stance then and now is the same – let it handle the small stuff, so you can better handle the big, creative work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur interest in AI has only grown since then, as ChatGPT went public, we published several articles mentioning AI on the blog, and we launched an AI Assistant. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpending time with the different tools powered by AI has allowed us to define our boundaries better. As a result, we already have unwritten rules around AI in content. However, a pattern emerged in two recent events that prompted us to ask ourselves: how do we let people know our stance on AI?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first was our latest (now closed) hiring run for a Content Writer. \u003ca href=\"https://buffer.com/resources/content-writer-applications/\"\u003eThis article\u003c/a\u003e goes into more detail, but a surprising amount of applications were completed using AI. Our understanding of the typical AI-generated content helped us identify these applications, but it was prevalent enough to highlight.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe second event is our currently-paused \u003ca href=\"https://buffer.com/resources/write-for-us/\"\u003eGuest Post Program\u003c/a\u003e. The idea of the program is to open up the Buffer blog to knowledge stories from creators and small business owners. We want skilled writing that feels personal and leaves our audience feeling like they’ve learned something valuable. But, again, many pitches that come through are AI-generated with little to no editing. They all followed the same structure we’ve recognized from AI-generated answers, especially those created in ChatGPT.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite the speculation that AI is a ticking time bomb for people in creative industries, we beg to differ. No tool can replace the human mind and its capacity to create art that connects deeply. Also, it’s worth remembering that AI is just an extensive language-learning model. It makes inferences from what you tell it and its limited bank of information to perform what several people have called “spicy autocomplete.” It’s a tool – only as good as the person who wields it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, yes, we had to take the time to clarify our stance because while it’s great, it’s not replacing any of us any time soon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"our-approach-to-ai-in-content\"\u003eOur approach to AI in content\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere are the four statements that cover 90 percent of how we think about using AI in content.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAI assists but doesn’t replace\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAI never writes complete drafts or paragraphs without being edited by a human\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAI content is always reviewed for accuracy\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe don’t believe AI can replace creative work in any sense\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/2023/06/Option-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"ai in content\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/Option-2.png 600w, https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/Option-2.png 1000w, https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/Option-2.png 1600w, https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/2023/06/Option-2.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"the-content-team%E2%80%99s-experience-with-ai\"\u003eThe Content team’s experience with AI\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBuffer’s Content team comprises four people who manage the team's blogs, social media, PR, and other content and communication-related needs. The size of our team versus our responsibilities often means we must turn down certain projects and opportunities. We need to prioritize, but at the end of the day, content and social are top priorities for our team, so they can't be put aside.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAdopting AI tools has allowed us to free up more time to explore these opportunities and collaborate with other teams more effectively. For example, the first edits are done with Grammarly instead of one of us to catch the most visible errors in grammar and punctuation. This allows us to focus on deeper-level structure, voice, and tone editing. I use Otter a lot to record interviews. It joins my Zoom calls and makes rough notes – meaning I don’t have to start listening and transcribing from scratch. It even gives a summary of each call.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOutside of AI-heavy tools, some of our other resources have AI incorporated into them like\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://threads.com/\"\u003eThreads\u003c/a\u003e, which we use for internal communication\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://notion.so\"\u003eNotion\u003c/a\u003e, which we use for knowledge management\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://canva.com\"\u003eCanva\u003c/a\u003e, for designing social media posts and blog graphics\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eand even Buffer.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eAI is an inevitable part of our process, and while we \u003cem\u003ecould \u003c/em\u003echoose not to use these tools, we’d all be less effective for it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"what-we-use-ai-for\"\u003eWhat we use AI for\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe use AI for important, time-consuming tasks that a nonhuman can do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTo proofread writing and check for grammatical errors\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTo unlock inspiration before getting to the research process\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTo help with outlines\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFor creating templates\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFor coming up with interview questions\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFor suggesting title ideas\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFor the first draft of social posts\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTo repurpose existing content for multiple channels\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTo make our content more relevant for a hyper-specific audience\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"what-we%E2%80%99re-not-using-ai-for\"\u003eWhat we’re not using AI for\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe do not and will never use AI to\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eResearch because it’s wrong more often than not\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFully draft articles \u003cem\u003eor\u003c/em\u003e write full paragraphs within our drafts – we use AI purely as a partner in brainstorming and writing\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCreate final posts for social media\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMake artwork entirely from scratch.

Will I make a good impression? How will I remember everyone’s names? How can I make sure I make the most of this in-person time? Will I make \u003cem\u003efriends\u003c/em\u003e?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s comforting to know that I’m likely not the only Bufferoo who feels this way. Retreats are a pillar of Buffer’s company culture. There have been ten international gatherings since Buffer was founded, attended by almost everyone on the team (at the time). \u003ca href=\"https://buffer.com/resources/buffer-retreats/\"\u003e\u003cu\u003eHere’s a round-up of all our retreats so far\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut, thanks to a series of unfortunate events (notably, a pandemic), more than half of my teammates are in the same boat as me. Buffer is a fully remote, global company; many of us have never been in a room with our teammates.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor the first time since 2019, that’s going to change. Almost 70 Bufferoos are flying from all over the world to gather in Cancún for a week of connection and collaboration.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I will never forget how extremely nervous I was for the first gathering during the retreat in 2013,” Åsa Nyström, VP of Customer Advocacy, told me. She’s been at Buffer for 11 years and attended every Buffer retreat. “While I feel more comfortable meeting everyone now, I would advise remembering that everyone feels a bit nervous as we gather in a new location. It’s not just you!”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHer advice for quieting the nerves? Ask questions. “Someone once advised me to ask questions if I was nervous when meeting new people, so that’s what I tend to do,” she said. “It helps me, at least.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I did.

But if possible, remember that we’re not a clique, and you’re always welcome to join any conversation and activity. It’s such a gift to connect and make friends with folks from other teams at the company, who are often based in other parts of the world.” — Asa\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“It's easy to gravitate towards familiar faces, especially if you're introverted. However, sitting with different people is a fantastic opportunity to get to know other team members better. Try to balance spending quality time with your usual team/friends and reaching out to teammates you don't interact with as much. It's a great way to get to know more people and can also help you feel less anxious as the week goes on because you will know a lot of folks better than you did at the beginning of the week.” — Mick\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Embrace the spontaneity. This is where the magic happens! When working in a remote setting, it can be easy to slip into comfortable habits, like sitting only with people you normally work with.

Retreats are incredible but jam-packed. Being swept up in all the excitement often means you forget about the basics, like getting enough water and sleep.

It might feel overwhelming, there might be some jetlag — be prepared to build in some time for yourself. Taking time to reflect, process, and recharge will help a lot.

This is a question that is always on my mind.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDelivering exceptional customer support has always been at the core of Buffer’s mission. Over the years, we've taken pride in our unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction and our dedicated support team's ability to go the extra mile.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat we have found is that as your volume and team size scale, it can be trickier to continue to really see and hear each customer reaching out over email, live chat, or social as the volume keeps building. An important aspect of customer support strategy at the stage we’re at is to keep being focused on our direction and the quality bar we are aiming for.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’ve spent a lot of time talking to our CEO,\u003ca href=\"https://joel.start.page/\"\u003e \u003cu\u003eJoel Gascoigne\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, about our vision for customer support and what it looks like to go above and beyond for our customers. In these conversations and brainstorms with our team, we take inspiration primarily from hospitality organizations. There is something magical about the service experience you can get at a great restaurant or in a smaller retail shop. That magic is something we strive to create over emails or social messaging. When looking at 75,000 customer conversations per year and ambitious response time goals, it's not always easy to balance speed with personal connection, but it's worth the investment.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn this blog post, I’ll share more about how we add hospitality to our own customer support approach at Buffer.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"what-is-a-hospitality-approach\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is a hospitality approach?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eA hospitality approach in customer service means that we strive to create standout, above-and-beyond, and personal experiences in every customer conversation.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThink about how, at a smaller boutique or five-star hotel, the staff takes a personal interest in their guests. The staff tends to notice particular needs someone might have or dig a bit deeper to see if they can make a guest’s stay more memorable.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOr, think about a great experience you’ve had at a restaurant, where a waiter or waitress did more than just provide excellent service but engaged in conversation, asked you about how your day was going or tried to get you a personalized food or drink recommendation.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you're in support at a tech company where customers often reach out to you about bugs, you might also find drawing inspiration from a standout mechanic helpful. This reflection came from one of our team members,\u003ca href=\"https://dave.start.page/\"\u003e \u003cu\u003eDave Chapman\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, as we brainstormed ways to better support our customers. These experiences are often really memorable when you have someone meeting you with a high level of empathy, listening to your concerns, and then going above and beyond to make sure your car gets fixed and even sort out a few other things as they do so.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese types of experiences are clear examples of a person being seen and heard, and these encounters stick out, where you leave with more than just your needs met and have a distinct impression of how great the experience was.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor us to keep this approach top of mind, we start by being curious and intentional in every customer conversation, plus we look for ways to personalize and connect during each interaction. We don’t simply answer customers’ support questions, but we also suggest additional ideas for how they might, for example, use Buffer or social media. We attempt to fix when something is broken, and where we can, we try and connect on a personal level.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"our-framework-for-ensuring-a-hospitality-approach-to-customer-support\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur framework for ensuring a hospitality approach to customer support\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe foundation of a hospitality approach to customer support is a team who are passionate about helping others and providing a standout customer experience. To provide the level of service we strive for, we need to be product experts, and we need to approach every conversation with awareness, clarity, and empowerment. We have a framework in place to support this mindset that we also use for quality reviews.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur review process aims to evaluate whether a Customer Advocate has approached the customer conversation with awareness (I understand and see you), clarity (I want to make sure you understand me), and empowerment (I can help you).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere are the three categories, as well as the evaluation metrics:\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"1-approaching-our-customers-with-awareness\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Approaching our customers with awareness\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe are so grateful our customers are using our product and also for taking the time to reach out to us. While we want to ensure we remove any product friction that leads to the need to reach out, we are thankful for our customers getting in touch. We want our gratitude and care for our customers to be reflected in our communication—every conversation matters.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe are intentional about taking the time to listen to our customer, and when we reply, it is clear that we’ve understood all of their questions or that we are seeking more information to understand them better. Our communication and care shows need to show a comprehensive grasp of the \u003cstrong\u003ecomplete picture\u003c/strong\u003e of the customer's situation and next steps.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTaking the time to really see the customer enables us to look between the lines for areas of frustration, opportunities to \u003cstrong\u003eempower our customers\u003c/strong\u003e further, or doorways to build a deeper relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"2-communicating-with-clarity\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. Communicating with clarity\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo create that hospitality feeling in written communication, we need to be bullish about our writing. Our communication is our only medium to show our personality and ensure our customer is looked after.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur writing reflects a playful professionalism, capable of having fun without sounding sloppy. We avoid jargon, insider language, or using concepts that are familiar to us but may be unfamiliar to the customer.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe provide the clearest path toward a resolution possible, focusing on how we can make it simple for customers to get to an answer. We make action steps and requests clear so customers don’t miss any required next steps.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe make every effort to make sure our replies move the conversation forward and get the customer closer to a resolution without unnecessary back-and-forth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"3-our-team-is-informed-and-empowered-to-help-our-customers\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. Our team is informed and empowered to help our customers\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe want to lead our customer service experience with a high level of enablement, both from the Advocate themselves and to enable our customers. For our team to reach this level of empowerment, we all must be highly informed. We aim to be experts, not only as customer service professionals but also as experts at our product and how our customers can successfully use our product.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe will go above and beyond to find information for our customers to provide the best possible experience, and we use the tools we have available. We always avoid asking the customer for information that we can find, and we’re always looking to improve customer insights through our tooling. We’re neither afraid to ask for help nor lean on each other to provide an above-and-beyond experience. We can better serve our customers by leaning into our experience as a professional and as a team. When uncertainty creeps in, we won’t be able to provide the level of service we aim for. We have found confidence and enablement to be foundational aspects of delivering a great experience, and we must continue to foster an environment of learning and coaching.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen we review our customer conversations, we’re looking for Customer Advocates to deliver on all three of the above categories, and we will simply score out of three. Each team member receives a monthly score and additional coaching notes from their manager. This is one way we keep growing and improving Buffer's customer service and experience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/2024/02/HospitalityBuffer.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"886\" srcset=\"https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/HospitalityBuffer.jpeg 600w, https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/HospitalityBuffer.jpeg 1000w, https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/size/w1600/2024/02/HospitalityBuffer.jpeg 1600w, https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/2024/02/HospitalityBuffer.jpeg 2000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eHere's a screenshot of what a Customer Advocate will see in their monthly scores.

If so, could we try to meet them there and make sure our reply acknowledges the place they are coming from?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAgain think of that experience as you walk into a hotel, are you stressed or just excited to be at your destination? You’ll often find that the staff sees you, responds immediately to your cues, and initiates the experience you seek. Stressed - let’s be efficient, Delighted - I am so excited you’re here, Overwhelmed - how can we improve your situation today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDid the customer give us any information about what type of business they’re running or what company they work for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eIs there anything we could help the customer with based on that information?

Or, at the very least, might be able to point them in the right direction. We call this “yes, and..”. We allow the customer to engage further where we don’t simply answer their question, we aim to provide more information that could help them use Buffer and social media to it’s full capabilities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"this-is-the-chance-to-make-someone%E2%80%99s-day\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is the chance to make someone’s day\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eHaving the opportunity to reflect on a hospitality approach, I think the team agrees that it has opened up a lot more opportunities for personal connection with our customers.

                                "html": "\u003cp\u003eWhen I tell people how long I’ve been at Buffer — eight years today — people generally have a lot of questions. But one of the most common is, “Why have you stayed so long?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEight years is an unusually long time to be at one company in tech. It’s also an unusually long time among most of my friend group except those who work in more traditional jobs, say in teaching or in government.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo why have I stayed?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy short answer is usually the same — it’s the people and the product. I truly enjoy working alongside the Buffer team, and I am also an avid user of the product for my personal social media accounts and have been since 2013. I really value the energy I feel from working alongside a group of talented and driven teammates and being consistently interested in what we are all working on. I love that I am eager to hear what the product team is doing because it impacts \u003ca href=\"https://buffer.com/resources/content-creation-system/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"\u003emy weekly content workflows\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s the short answer — I’m still here because of the people and the product, and it’s true. But I wanted to take the opportunity of hitting a new milestone to do a little bit of a longer post and a deeper reflection because it is more than that. The people and the product make my work much more enjoyable, interesting, and relevant, but that isn’t everything.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"sometimes-staying-is-the-hard-option\"\u003eSometimes, staying is the hard option\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’ve been at Buffer through various job markets, and Buffer’s brand name carries weight. I’ve had many recruiters reach out over the years about new and interesting roles. I’ve had connections introduce me to someone who was keen to hire me. I was at Buffer during what was later called the Great Resignation when several of my teammates, some also friends, chose to move on to other companies. The job market was very strong at the time for my area; there were a lot of incredible opportunities, and when you see most of your peers moving on, it’s hard not to ask, “Should I be doing the same?” And potentially the strongest pull — I had my first child while at Buffer and struggled to come to terms with coming back to work and balancing having a baby a few months old at home. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI have stayed through it all, and I haven’t just stayed because it was the easier option. When I came back from family leave, it coincided with the Great Resignation — I was adjusting to having a baby at home and working while our Marketing team was severely understaffed, and I started moving into a leadership position on the team. It was a particularly challenging time in both exciting and hard ways. Sometimes, staying was the harder option, but it was still the option that I wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"i-continue-to-be-challenged\"\u003eI continue to be challenged\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the most recurring things I’ll have several friends tell me is that it’s better for your career to move to a different company. You can often get higher pay, get promoted quickly, and learn new things at a very fast rate. While I agree that those are all true, I am also still learning and growing at Buffer.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy role has changed entirely since I’ve been working at Buffer; I went from purely an individual contributor to someone who is both an individual contributor and managing a team. When I joined Buffer, my work was heavily focused on media relations. Over time, that started to shift to include content, wider company, communications, and now Buffer’s brand. The change has been a welcome one to continue to push me to learn new skills and get deep into new areas of Marketing.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI also moved into a leadership position within the Marketing team, and I continue to work on engaging and complex challenges that are key to Buffer’s brand and business. I am not doing the same job I was hired to do eight years ago, which is exactly how I would want it. I’ve learned so much from taking on new projects and trying to attain new results over the years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"buffer-pays-me-fairly-and-generously\"\u003eBuffer pays me fairly and generously\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s important to share that another reason to stay at any company is compensation. One of Buffer’s compensation principles is generosity, and I’ve found that to be true. My starting salary at Buffer was $82,790, which was more than double my previous salary of $37,500. Over the last eight years, my salary has continued to go up either because I was advancing in my work or because Buffer was adjusting to market rates with our approach to fair compensation. \u003ca href=\"https://buffer.com/salaries\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"\u003eMy current salary\u003c/a\u003e is $172,861 — more than double what it was when I started at Buffer eight years ago.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis wouldn’t be the case for everyone on the team who has been at Buffer for a long time because they came in at different levels, and their roles might have shifted less than mine. I joined at a pretty junior level and have worked my way over time to take on more ownership. Now, I am running part of our Marketing team, so my compensation has adjusted fairly with the work and responsibilities I’ve taken on. This is also unique — not every company has a transparent and fair \u003ca href=\"https://buffer.com/resources/salary-system/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"\u003esalary system\u003c/a\u003e that would continue to adjust with me over time. For some people I know, moving to a new company has been the only way for them to increase their salary. I haven’t had that issue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"deep-knowledge-and-context-are-adding-to-my-work\"\u003eDeep knowledge and context are adding to my work\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBeing in one place for so long could easily be seen as a bad thing — maybe I’m stagnant, I’m not adding new ideas, I’m continuing to do things the way they used to be. This one is the hardest to grapple with because there is a lot of truth. I could easily find myself stuck, and I have been in that position over the years. This only adds to the challenge, though. Can I find new perspectives from peers in my industry or through continual learning and experimentation? Can I question the way that I do work so that we aren’t staying frozen with an old strategy?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOver time, I believe I’ve managed to flip my longevity from something that could be a detraction from the value I bring the team to being one of my unique superpowers within Buffer. Since my work is so close to Buffer’s brand, and I’m frequently working to share Buffer’s culture externally, that context continues to be additive. I've accumulated a wealth of knowledge about Buffer specifically, and that context allows me to contribute more effectively and strategically. It's not just about doing things the way they've always been done; it's about using the depth of understanding to innovate and guide the brand forward.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"buffer-is-something-i-want-to-be-a-part-of\"\u003eBuffer is something I want to be a part of\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat it comes to is that I believe in Buffer, and this is something I want to be a part of. With Buffer, not only is our team building an essential tool for people who don’t have large budgets — creators and small business owners — but Buffer as a company is also being built in a very intentional way. We’re \u003ca href=\"https://buffer.com/transparent-pricing\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"\u003efully transparent with our pricing\u003c/a\u003e, our salaries, and \u003ca href=\"https://buffer.com/open\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"\u003emany other parts of Buffer are transparent\u003c/a\u003e.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://joel.start.page/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"\u003eJoel Gascoigne\u003c/a\u003e, Buffer’s Founder and CEO, is extremely intentional about the decisions that he makes for the Buffer team and company. He implemented a \u003ca href=\"https://buffer.com/resources/4-day-workweek/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"\u003efour-day workweek\u003c/a\u003e during the pandemic because of the risk he spotted of burnout; we have a generous sabbatical policy because we know that after five years of working somewhere, a bit of extra space for rest and reflection can greatly help. It’s the kind of workplace where there are a lot of reasons to stay, and a lot of people do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"a-lot-of-people-stay-at-buffer-for-a-long-time\"\u003eA lot of people stay at Buffer for a long time\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’m not the exception by being at Buffer for eight years; there are a lot of teammates who have been here much longer than I have. When we looked at the numbers in November for \u003ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joelgascoigne_13-years-ago-today-i-launched-buffer-it-activity-7136168417723629568-e0Zv?utm_source=share\u0026amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"\u003eBuffer’s 13-year anniversary\u003c/a\u003e, we found that 49 percent of the team has been at Buffer for over five years, another 39 percent have been at Buffer for seven years, and six percent have been on the team for more than a decade. Buffer is being built to be a long-term company, and there are a lot of people on the team committed to continuing to be at Buffer for the long haul as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’m sure I’ll continue to get asked why I’ve stayed at Buffer for so long by friends and industry peers — my story is still quite unusual. But, while it’s difficult in tech to find companies that have a more long-term approach to building a business, it’s not impossible. I admire the leaders who find those long-term opportunities, and after eight years of feeling happy, challenged, and interested in the work every day, I’m thrilled to be one of them.\u003c/p\u003e",

Compensation is directly connected with life overall, in supporting peoples’ livelihoods and their dreams. It is also intertwined with fairness and equity, as the choices a company makes around compensation will be a key component of how they value people and whether there are differences in how they treat people. With transparency, any kind of favoritism is surfaced and visible. We believe that it is vital that team members have full information about how and why we make the decisions we do around compensation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe have chosen to create a system where conversations around compensation can happen in the open. Rather than concerns around salaries being kept to private conversations, we strive to operate with practices and a culture where we can be involved in those discussions. We can move those conversations towards fairness and merit in our approaches, and if we determine a valid issue is identified, we can make a change that benefits everyone impacted. External transparency enables prospective candidates of Buffer to deeply understand our unique Salary System. This means that people can enter our hiring process aware of very specific details of how we work. Leaning fully into external transparency in this way holds us to an even higher standard as we open ourselves up to public scrutiny on our approach to salaries.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll of this leads to greater trust. We believe that trust is the foundation of great teamwork, and we’ve learned from over a decade of experience that transparency breeds trust.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe serve creators, entrepreneurs, and small businesses who often lack time, knowledge, or resources to do something to the high standard they might strive for. When it comes to compensation, sharing the entirety of our salary methodology can provide an invaluable resource to speed up the implementation of solid practices for these businesses.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"reflecting-on-a-decade-of-transparent-salaries\"\u003eReflecting on a decade of transparent salaries\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"committing-to-salary-transparency-and-growing-with-strong-values\"\u003eCommitting to salary transparency and growing with strong values\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen we started down this road, we first made salaries transparent \u003cem\u003einternally.\u003c/em\u003e This was grounded in our overall commitment to transparency as a company. There were a variety of workflows and rituals that we chose to make transparent, such as our metrics and finances, internal and external communication, and our efforts toward self-improvement (another of our values).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen we took a step further and published our salaries for anyone to see, it came with some discomfort. Many of us had fears over what could go wrong if we did it… would competitors have an easier time poaching our teammates? Would we feel awkward with our peers? We spent a long time talking through these fears as a group and then ultimately challenged ourselves to fully uphold our value to Default to Transparency.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter all of those discussions, it turned out that the response we got was overwhelmingly positive, beyond anything we could have imagined. Importantly, we also received a lot of useful feedback on the salary formula and the data itself. That was when we realized the impact of sharing externally, and how this can serve us in holding ourselves to the high standard we are striving for.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEver since then, we have repeatedly been reminded that if we are clear on our values and completely committed to living them genuinely, great things happen. This alignment is the foundation for so much of what makes us feel special and allows us to carve our own path as a company and a team. The people who are drawn to join us are clear on their own personal values, and in fact new teammates often share that they feel like they’ve found their professional home.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"growing-as-a-company-over-a-decade\"\u003eGrowing as a company over a decade\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s worth reflecting on some of the key differences in Buffer as a company today compared to a decade ago when we first established transparent salaries:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBuffer in 2013:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe were a team of 17 people\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe had 8 different roles\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe average salary at Buffer was $100,812\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe had an Annual Revenue Run Rate (ARR) of $2.2M\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOur average revenue per team member was $129,411\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBuffer today:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe are a team of 75 people\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe have 30 different roles\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe average salary at Buffer is $151,113\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe have an Annual Revenue Run Rate (ARR) of $18M\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOur average revenue per team member is $240,000\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we’ve grown over the years, we’ve seen our approach to salaries be stretched and tested in different ways. Of course, as the number of people and roles on the team increase, we need to make amendments to our salary approach to achieve our goal of maintaining transparency and fairness. We made a number of iterations over the years to our salary formula, but until now, we haven’t made a fundamental change to the overall approach to salaries. That’s what we’re sharing today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"our-journey-of-salary-approaches\"\u003eOur journey of salary approaches\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’ve had a number of iterations of our salary formula over the years. We initially made a significant change to our salary formula roughly every two years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2015, we made our first significant iteration of the salary formula. We evolved our calculation for base salary so that beyond just a different number for each role, we incorporated market benchmarks, too. We did this while attempting to avoid significant disparity in pay between locations; by lifting salaries higher proportionally for those in lower cost of living locations. We called this the Good Life Curve. This is also where we introduced some flexibility into the formula to enable us to deviate from market benchmarks where we had a different belief in the value of the role. For example, we placed a higher importance on customer service, so we lifted those salaries by 10 percent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur next iteration of the salary formula came in 2017, and this is where we first introduced the concept of a Buffer Benchmark. This is an element we’ve adapted and taken to a new level of clarity and simplicity in our Salary System. The Buffer Benchmark was our way of creating our own competitive base salaries for each role, incorporating both market data and our own adjustments in a more sophisticated way than previously. This is when we became clear that market data should be a starting point for determining our salaries, and we should maintain a level of flexibility in how we use it rather than taking market data and using it directly for salaries. 2017 was also the point in time when we started to arrive at the need for a guiding strategy or set of principles for our salary approach. Those principles were Simple and Accessible, Do the Right Thing, Adaptable, and Competitive. These are fairly aligned with the Compensation Principles we later set down, which guided our work on the new Salary System.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2018, we made another important update to our salary formula. The most significant upgrade was migrating to a commercial and more robust market data source — Radford. This was a big step for us compared to the market data we were previously utilizing. Radford had endless roles and a decent sample size of salary data across most roles and levels. This gave us confidence that our salaries were being based upon clear market data and that we had a good sense of where we fell in the market. One of the errors we made with this iteration, however, was that we did not constrain the market data by company size or stage. This meant that the range of salaries included in the data set was too wide and detracted from the true accuracy of where we sat in the market relative to other companies our size. This is something we have corrected in the Salary System. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother important change we made in 2018 was to get more consistent in our approach to pulling in new market data. With Radford, we could regularly take new market benchmarks and adjust all of our salaries to keep up with the current market levels. Finally, we also chose at this stage to introduce steps between each of the levels of seniority. This gave managers some flexibility and autonomy in rewarding smaller steps of progression for career growth instead of a whole level every time, which often meant a title change.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEach salary formula iteration came at a financial cost to us as a company, as we committed to not lower salaries based on a formula or market data change. As an example, our 2018 update came at an increase in salary expenses of $711,565 per year. Often, salaries would rise for a whole function when we made changes to our approach or pulled in new market benchmarks. These costs are not insignificant; however, we came to value the consistency and trust gained as a result of adhering to our approach. It was a powerful vote of confidence in people that we would proactively raise salaries as we resolved flaws in our approach or when the market indicated salaries had increased. I believe that this is one of the reasons we have significant average tenure in the team and many people who have been at Buffer for over five years and a few who have even been at the company for over a decade.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe shared each of these salary formula iterations publicly, and we were open along the way about what we had not been able to include or fix in each version. In this way, we typically had a clear roadmap for the future of transparent salaries.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"a-living-formula-and-system\"\u003eA living formula and system\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince the very early years of implementing a salary formula, we’ve been aware that for it to work, we will need to make continual iterations. A salary system can never be perfect, for a few different reasons.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMarkets change and sometimes may change in unanticipated ways. Flexibility to adjust the numbers, and even the whole system, is necessary to maintain something that is fresh and feels like it truly works for us. One of the key ways we’ve developed to handle this has been regular \u003ca href=\"https://buffer.com/resources/increase-salaries-every-year/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"\u003erebenchmarking\u003c/a\u003e, where we go and get new base salary numbers for all roles in the company to bring us up to date with the market.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother reason a salary system will never be perfect is that we’re a small, growing company, and as we grow, we need new roles and perhaps even entirely new functions. When this happens, we need to bring those roles into the system and find salary benchmarks. In some cases, there may even be components of compensation we have not accounted for, which we need to build into our system. We’ve always aimed to add to our formula in a way that holistically considers all members of the company and reflects any changes across all relevant roles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, we must embrace that the only constant is change with a working salary formula. This is not always the easiest thing to do because salaries are a sensitive aspect of employment to think about changing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"downsides-to-salary-transparency\"\u003eDownsides to salary transparency\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are a few downsides we’ve found over the years in maintaining salary transparency, and these are important to face head-on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHaving a salary system and being transparent in a way that holds us strongly accountable can create rigidity and make some necessary adjustments feel slower to be able to implement. This can especially be the case with brand-new roles, which we have to add to the formula. It also applies to flaws we discover in the process of hiring someone, which we then have to run through and determine if we are in a position to adjust many salaries rather than just one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn general, salary transparency, along with other types of transparency, does inherently create extra work for us. The work in adhering to salary transparency, including our formula and the communication required to guide people through how it works, is not insignificant.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBeing too strict in full transparency of salaries can mean that we are insensitive to situations where it may not feel appropriate for someone to share their salary publicly. On the other hand, no one generally feels completely comfortable with sharing their salary publicly, but the positive impact we can have of collectively doing this is significant. This can be a fine line to hold.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’ve come to very strongly believe that the benefits and the positive impact we can have on the industry by leading by a strong and somewhat extreme example here, make these downsides worth pushing through.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"growing-complexity-and-discrepancies\"\u003eGrowing complexity and discrepancies\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eOver time, the required changes started taking longer and being more painful to implement. Our iterations became fewer and further apart. We pushed our spreadsheet to the limit, updates became less intentional and more spontaneous, and the salary formulas across functions became progressively less consistent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNaturally, as we grew, we needed to account for greater complexity. The problem was that we weren’t pushing enough ourselves to ensure that as we added complexity, we also improved the user experience of exploring and working with our salary spreadsheet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a business, we started to lose sight of the benefits of maintaining not just transparency but also simplicity in the system. I only later realized that even if we may be able to continue stating that our salary approach is transparent, if it is hard to understand, then it erodes the trust that we gained early on. This happened gradually over time until we reached a place where only our dedicated, specialized finance team could truly understand the system. For the wider team, what was left was transparency of the numbers but not of how we reached them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe started to feel cracks in our approach to salaries in two key areas: discrepancies in the application of our formula, and a gradual increase in complexity leading to deterioration in transparency. When the formula is not applied consistently, discrepancies occur, and this can result in a lack of complete fairness and equity in salaries. This goes against the very reasons we put salary transparency in place to begin with. And, when the ability to understand the way we arrive at salaries deteriorates, it undermines the level of trust in our approach and reduces the amount of feedback we receive from people who explore our salaries fully.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"maintaining-and-losing-trust-and-integrity-in-our-system\"\u003eMaintaining and losing trust and integrity in our system\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition to the transparency, there is another element required to maintain trust, and that is adhering to the formula and overall system. I take this responsibility seriously since the trust we’ve gained over the years can quickly unravel if we deviate from the system. This is something that for the majority of our decade with transparent salaries we have achieved.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith the increasing complexity of our salary formula and how it was implemented, it gradually became more challenging to work with. We deliberately expanded and adjusted our formula in specific areas where we couldn’t make the same formula work, such as customer advocacy, where we placed a different value on the role, or the executive team, where we determined we needed to pay slightly further above market to attract new leaders who could help us get to the next stage as a business. Our salary approach and implementation became more convoluted, and there started to be regular instances where a hiring manager struggled to easily find the salary they should offer a new team member. And then, we made our biggest mistake of all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA couple of years ago, we made a mistake in how we implemented our formula when making an offer to a teammate. The error occurred in a particularly high-pressure season, and I know this was purely a mistake and came from a place of feeling a weight of responsibility to get Buffer on a great track. We ended up making an offer at a lower level of seniority than appropriate but with the incorrect (and higher) location band for their city. It meant that this individual, unbeknownst to them, received a salary that deviated from our formula. Since we maintain full transparency, a few people in the team noticed the discrepancy and brought it to our attention. It pained me significantly that this error happened. I knew at that moment that we had lost some trust in our salary approach; team members could not know for sure that we did not intentionally break away from the standardized formula.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSoon after this mistake, I took full responsibility for the mistake, corrected the salary, and shared the full details of how it occurred with the wider team. At that time, in mid-2022, I made a commitment to working back towards our high bar for salary transparency and simplicity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’ve reflected that for almost every other company out there, these types of discrepancies are just a part of life. Offers are made differently by hiring managers, negotiation happens and may affect the salary number, and promotions may be unevenly distributed. For us, however, we had never had these types of discrepancies, and our complete commitment to transparency and fairness is what made the whole approach work. As soon as we had a clear discrepancy occur, it started to feel like the whole approach was at risk of breaking down.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"making-the-decision-to-overhaul-our-approach-and-resolve-the-debt\"\u003eMaking the decision to overhaul our approach and resolve the debt\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn general, I had been feeling that our salary system had deteriorated over the previous few years. I was no longer proud of our approach, and I rarely heard from people with questions and suggestions for changes we could make. This indicated to me that we were no longer succeeding with our original ideals for salary transparency.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter some chaotic and less focused years, we were arriving at a place as a company where we could improve and take things to a new level. This was mirrored across a variety of other areas. 2023 was the year that we drove a turnaround in our shipping pace, improved our metrics more than any of the previous three years, enhanced the quality of our strategy, became closer as teammates and with customers, and made a renewed commitment to our values.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen we stepped back and reflected on why we weren’t successful in avoiding these pitfalls in salary transparency, it became clear that, fundamentally, it was due to the fact that we always thought of our approach to salaries as a formula. A formula alone did not have enough flexibility to adapt to new roles, market data, and our evolution as a company. We decided to rethink our approach from the ground up, and this is how we arrived at our Salary System.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"more-open-dialogue-around-our-salary-system\"\u003eMore open dialogue around our salary system\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eSomething that became clear over the years from our experience of operating with transparent salaries is that in order to maintain the high trust in our approach, there needs to be some level of regular discussion around it across the entire company. This shouldn’t be so much that it causes distraction from the areas we’ve been entrusted to drive forward, and the system should feel solid and be something we all trust in general.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, without the ability and a clear way to share feedback, it can feel like the rigidity of a salary formula and salary transparency really become downsides, as we lose individual agency in impacting the system and our own salary, at least in some form. And on the company side, without feedback from folks across the organization, there’s no way we will be able to anticipate all the scenarios and differences that might need to be factors in our approach.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith salary formula discrepancy and a mistake, the fact that our system is transparent led to multiple people spotting the issue and raising it. This is one of the powerful things about having transparency, and I’m very grateful to everyone who chose to raise the concern and point out the discrepancy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe have plans to create more specific opportunities and structures for team members to share their feedback on our system. This started with putting in the work to revamp our entire approach and make it more understandable, and then share it in detail. We did this internally through presentations in a couple of our monthly All Hands meetings and by building out a comprehensive wiki for the Salary System detailing various aspects of the implementation and our philosophies. This is also why we’re sharing our lessons learned and our new system today. Increasing the amount of input we get will hold us even more accountable, ensure greater integrity of the approach, and lead to more trust and pride in our commitment to salary transparency.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"our-compensation-principles\"\u003eOur Compensation Principles\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eOver the years, we started to reach clarity that it would be important to capture the key principles with which we approach salary decisions and changes. This led to us establishing a set of \u003ca href=\"https://buffer.com/resources/compensation-philosophy/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"\u003eCompensation Principles\u003c/a\u003e a few years ago. Upon establishing the principles, they guided us in making a number of smaller, iterative improvements to our salary formula, which started to get us back on track. And in the second half of last year, they guided our efforts in fundamentally re-imagining our approach to salaries and arriving at the Salary System.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur Compensation Principles are derived from our \u003ca href=\"https://buffer.com/about\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"\u003eValues\u003c/a\u003e and Operating Principles.

We openly share our approach and our salaries publicly to hold us to an even greater standard and to serve as a resource for the industry. We believe that the world would be a better and more equitable place with more transparency around pay, and we have chosen to drive this shift to our full capabilities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSimplicity\u003c/strong\u003e: We aim to maintain an easy-to-understand approach to salaries that allows anyone to easily see how we arrive at any individual salary. Transparency is achievable without simplicity; however, when we also succeed in keeping salaries simple, it makes the understanding of how salaries work much more accessible to everyone, and this enhances the trust that we gain from our focus on transparency and fairness.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFairness\u003c/strong\u003e: We believe that those with the same role and responsibilities who are at the same experience level should be paid equitably. We believe in maintaining fairness, and attracting those who value that fairness, over deviating from our approach to clinch a specific skillset we may need at a particular moment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGenerosity\u003c/strong\u003e: We pay above market to attract high performing team members, and to create the possibility of a small, tight-knit team that achieves great outcomes together. We believe that when we achieve results as a cohesive team, the rewards of those outcomes should be shared with those who created them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"building-a-salary-system-for-the-long-term\"\u003eBuilding a salary system for the long-term\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003ePutting together all of our lessons learned, deeper reflections, and clarity on the flaws uncovered, we determined that we were ready to take a more fundamental change to our approach to salaries.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe realized that we had accrued enough debt in both the salary formula, our implementation of it, and the existing salaries and leveling of the team, that it would be best to take a first-principles approach and reflect on how we think about and calculate salaries at Buffer. We wanted to put in place a system that could serve us in this decade rather than the previous one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe key breakthrough we had was that a salary formula alone was not adequate to capture the variety of changes we need to make over time in our approach to salaries. This led us to arrive at a Salary System.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur Salary System could contain the salary formula; the literal equation used to arrive at an individual salary. But it could also contain the market data, the ways we pull in fresh market data, and how we adjust benchmarks to make them our own. We also wanted to make it straightforward to maintain legacy salaries in those instances where we arrived at a lower salary with new market data or formula changes. By making legacy salaries from a previous formula a core part of the overall system, it would give us the ability to once again make more frequent improvements. Team members would always keep the previous salary if it was higher until a future formula change or promotion led to an increased salary.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe other vital breakthrough was the importance of separation of concerns. Previously, we included everything in a single spreadsheet. With our new Salary System, we decided that we would have three separate spreadsheets, as we have three fundamentally different elements of our approach. We chose to keep market data completely separate from the way it is utilized. This would allow us to easily swap out market data for fresh benchmarks or even a completely new source. It also enables the team to view market data prior to any adjustments by us, which increases the overall visibility into our system. We also separate Buffer Benchmarks, where we pull in market data and adjust it to arrive at our own benchmarks for each role and level, from the overall salaries spreadsheet, which shows the list of everyone in the team and their title, role, location, and salary.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"the-buffer-salary-system\"\u003eThe Buffer Salary System\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEvolving from a salary formula to a salary system means that it isn’t something we can share in one sentence, but at the same time, the overall system is more flexible and adaptable to scale and grow with us over time. We believe what we’ve arrived at is as simple as possible, and as complex as necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are three parts to Buffer’s new salary system, and we intentionally designed the elements of this system to live independently of one another.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarket data: \u003c/strong\u003eMarket data of salaries in tech for our company size, which we derive our salaries from.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBuffer benchmarks\u003c/strong\u003e: A grid of the salaries for every role and level we have in the company.

We have gone through several data sources over the years, and in this move to a new salary system, we moved to \u003ca href=\"https://carta.com/equity-management/compensation/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"\u003eCarta Compensation\u003c/a\u003e as our data source. We chose Carta because it allows us to compare salaries with other companies that are peers in terms of industry, financials, and size. Carta Compensation also collects its data directly from HRIS (i.e., payroll) integrations, so data is flowing in continuously, which allows for updated market data on a regular basis. The platform is also intuitive and easy to use.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe market data that we use is filtered by company size (based on post-money valuation) and location (we use San Francisco, CA). Our salary system is built in a way that it is easy to update and adjust the market data inputs, so we can change our source of data at anytime. The market data informs the Buffer benchmarks, which are unique to Buffer and ultimately determine a teammate’s salary.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"buffer-benchmarks\"\u003eBuffer Benchmarks\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the highest level, the Buffer Benchmark is a grid of every role at Buffer with every level within that role.

In traditional market data, the jumps might be inconsistent. We’ve made them consistent for Buffer while adding a “fast early growth” track to apply for some areas like Finance and Advocacy where there was a lower entry-level point and, therefore, it made more sense to apply a higher percentage increase early on (i.e., levels one to three). At level four, the jumps even out to align with the Standard Path.\u0026nbsp;See below the increases that we have for all levels at Buffer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/2024/01/salary-system-level-increases.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"605\" srcset=\"https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/salary-system-level-increases.png 600w, https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/salary-system-level-increases.png 1000w, https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/size/w1600/2024/01/salary-system-level-increases.png 1600w, https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/size/w2400/2024/01/salary-system-level-increases.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can see the exception is the CEO salary. We’ve embraced the concept that the CEO salary should be primarily tied to the performance of the company. The formula for CEO salary is simpler than other roles due to the lack of levels.

With those numbers, we are able to extrapolate to determine salaries for every percentile from 70th to 90th. This is the range of percentiles we use for salaries at Buffer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStarting with the level five market data, we then apply a specific percentile per area. With our prior data source, we used to pay all roles at the 50th percentile of market data for San Francisco. This meant that our salaries fell at exactly the average or midpoint of salaries in our industry. This was, however, without filtering based on our size and stage of company.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince we started using Carta Compensation as our data source, we’ve seen a significant improvement here. The data source itself is a much better representation of our industry, and we are using a company-size filter that is accurate for the stage we are at.

The salary choice does not make sense for us at the current stage of the company, and we plan to eventually phase it out, likely when we attain our vision for \u003ca href=\"https://buffer.com/resources/location-independent-salaries/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"\u003elocation-independent salaries\u003c/a\u003e.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"a-detailed-view-of-the-buffer-team%E2%80%99s-salaries\"\u003eA detailed view of the Buffer team’s salaries\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere are the new salaries we arrived at for the whole Buffer team based on our new Salary System.

A first principles approach means aiming to break down something to its most fundamental truths. In the case of salaries, this means asking ourselves questions such as “What are salaries?”, “How should salaries be determined?” “What are the core components that should make up a salary?” and “What is absolutely necessary to factor into determining a salary versus what can be left out?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur beliefs on salaries\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe believe that a salary is the appropriate remuneration for work put in to contribute to making our company a success. We believe that pay should be in relation to the stage and state (performance) of the company, the role and the impact that role has on the business, and the seniority of the position in terms of the level of responsibilities and impact that on the company.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt its most basic principles, we believe a salary number should be tied to the value that work brings to the business in direct monetary terms. In reality, this is very hard to quantify, and the ability to quantify varies drastically between roles. Therefore, we also value the market rates and believe in the concept of a market for compensation. With enough individuals and companies, a market is formed based on the pay companies offer and the pay employees expect.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBased on the existence of a market for compensation and our preference for this methodology over attempting to value every role, we heavily utilize market data in our approach to salaries. We have created a level of flexibility in our approach to enable us to have some element of value-driven differences in salaries based on a foundation of market-driven salaries.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere we choose to sit in the market\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen reflecting on the market of salaries and where we want to sit in the market, we have determined that we want to pay on the upper end of market rates for most roles. This is reflected in our Compensation Principles, specifically to be Generous. The reason for this choice is that we want to have a small-for-revenues, high-performing, tight-knit team in line with our Operating Principles. We want the team to generally not be concerned about compensation, and be able to focus on delivering value to customers and creating something special.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFairness and transparency change the power dynamic and build trust\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe fundamentally believe that pay should be fair and equitable. Again, our Compensation Principles reflect this with our Fair principle alongside Transparency. Being fair leads us to have a clear system and formula for salaries and limiting opportunities for discrepancies and exceptions. Transparency means that anyone can verify that we are, in fact, being fair and meeting our other stated goals since they can see the entirety of the methodology. This helps us to establish full trust in our approach to salaries as a company.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur salary methodology changes the power dynamic that usually exists at companies. Where most companies keep their methodology secretive and opaque as it puts them in the stronger negotiation and power position, we choose to make our methodology and all salaries fully transparent. Candidates and team members have full information to make their decisions and can actively share feedback, which can and often does lead to changes to the system that positively impact everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"a-rising-tide-lifts-all-boats-salaries\"\u003eA rising tide lifts all boats (salaries)\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eA core philosophy of our Salary System and Compensation Principles is that over time, adjustments we make to refine and improve the approach, or changes we make when we have more resources, will benefit everyone at Buffer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is reflected in how salary negotiation works at Buffer, where we do not allow negotiation to change or impact salary numbers and instead take on negotiation as a point of feedback.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePut simply, we will never make a change that solely benefits a single person. Any change that results in a change of one or more salaries in the team will be a change to our salary system and formula itself. Therefore, it will almost always impact several people; specifically, it will impact all salaries where the specific change is a factor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"the-appropriate-level-of-simplicity\"\u003eThe appropriate level of simplicity\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen reflecting on Simple as one of our Compensation Principles, it may not feel at first impression that our Salary System is indeed simple. Our goal has been to create a system that is as simple as possible while also being as complex as necessary. There are a few examples of where we believe greater simplicity is possible (see what’s next below).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the whole, however, we believe that if the Salary System were any simpler, it would not meet all of our stated goals or capture all the key differences in how a salary should be determined. And, if it were any more complex, it would detract from our pursuit of simplicity and transparency.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"how-we-approach-the-ceo-salary\"\u003eHow we approach the CEO salary\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe CEO salary is a unique case within a company. Whereas every other role has the concept of levels, progression, and seniority, there isn't really the concept of a junior or senior CEO or a level six, eight, or ten CEO. Of course, CEOs grow and learn over time and become more experienced. However, those learnings should generally translate into company growth that can lead to salary increases, rather than choosing to increase the salary separately. The idea that a CEO does not have levels or seniority is corroborated by our market data source, Carta Compensation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen approaching salaries from first principles, the conclusion is that CEO pay should be very closely aligned with the success of the company and the positive impact the results have on customers and the team. If the CEO is successful in their role, then the company will grow, and it will have the ability to pay higher salaries across the board.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s also vital that CEO pay is transparent since, in many companies, this is not the case and is a key source of distrust. CEOs are often excessively overpaid, and the gap between the lowest and highest salaries in companies can be extreme. This is one of the reasons why salaries are transparent at Buffer.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"we-have-no-salary-negotiation-at-buffer\"\u003eWe have no salary negotiation at Buffer\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eNegotiation is a very common practice when it comes to how compensation works generally across our industry. As we focused on approaching salaries from first principles, we also reflected deeply on the why behind salary negotiation, and the implications of salary negotiation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSalary negotiation is largely necessary because without negotiating, individuals will end up with a lower salary than they deserve or than is possible. This is very much because most companies strive to pay the minimum salary they can negotiate for themselves. This could be argued as an efficiency gain, however, we believe that there is a significant lost opportunity for trust in the company, in leadership, and among the team with this approach.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe impact of salary negotiation and why it isn’t a fit for our goals\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe direct implication of negotiation occurring and a salary being determined through a process of negotiation is that there will be discrepancies in salaries across the same role and level. We hold ourselves to a high standard and fully adhering to our Compensation Principles. By holding ourselves to having Fair salaries, we have committed to no discrepancies or exceptions in salaries of the same role at the same level. Further, we are committed to having a very clear system for our salaries and full transparency of that system.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo achieve these outcomes, \u003cstrong\u003ewe have no salary negotiation at Buffer\u003c/strong\u003e. Where a salary negotiation conversation occurs or feedback is shared on the outcomes of our salary system, we treat this as an input to improve the system overall. The Salary System is always evolving and is never complete; it is more comprehensive today as we have grown significantly from our early days, and in the future, when we grow larger, there will be roles or necessary elements that aren’t currently captured.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTherefore, it is essential that we have ongoing feedback so that we can understand any issues and improve the system. When we find an issue that should be resolved, the improvement will positively impact everyone in a role where that particular change is relevant to them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"what%E2%80%99s-next-for-salaries-at-buffer\"\u003eWhat’s next for salaries at Buffer?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the benefits of our new salary system is that the extensive rebuilding of our salary methodology means that it is relatively easy for us to explore future scenarios of changes we could make. There are a number of changes we have in mind for the future, which represent areas of opportunity to further simplify our approach and adhere even more to our Compensation Principles.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is important to note that all of these scenarios would have a budget impact; the budget impact based on the team as of December 2023 is listed below for each scenario.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"location-independent-salaries\"\u003eLocation-Independent Salaries\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe have a long-term goal that salaries at Buffer will not be based on location. We stated this commitment when we shared our vision for \u003ca href=\"https://buffer.com/resources/location-independent-salaries/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"\u003elocation-independent salaries\u003c/a\u003e in early 2022 and made our first significant step towards it by eliminating two of the four location bands we had at the time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday, salaries fall on either the global or high band. Global sits at 90 percent of the high band. It’s important to note that by paying 90 percent market rates which are based on San Francisco, we are already paying well above market for almost every location in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe can explore a scenario where we bring our 90 percent global cost of living band up to 100 percent and eliminate the concept of cost of living entirely from our salary system.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnual budget impact: $1,030,772\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eNote: we will likely remove the Salary Choice when we carry out this change (see below for more details). This would lead to an adjusted annual budget impact of $820,772.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"aligning-percentiles\"\u003eAligning Percentiles\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne area we plan to improve in the future is to align the percentiles we use across the company. In this update, we matched percentiles with our prior formula, which has kept salaries mostly consistent but resulted in a lack of clear consistency of percentiles across the team. For the updated percentiles, we have two scenarios:\u003c/p\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe could bring all areas up to at least the 80th percentile.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnual budget impact: $314,467\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003col start=\"2\"\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe could bring all areas up to at least the 85th percentile.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnual budget impact: $802,551\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"salary-choice\"\u003eSalary Choice\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen we are in the position to be able to make significant changes to our salary system as detailed in the scenarios above, we will take the opportunity to remove the Salary Choice, which is a legacy element of the Salary System from the earlier days of our salary formula, which was more appropriate for the early stages of the company. This will most likely be a change we make when we eventually move to Location-Independent Salaries.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe currently have 21 team members with the Salary Choice option applied to their salary. Three of these team members are in the high-cost-of-living band; the other 18 are in global cost-of-living locations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnual budget impact: -$210,000.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"my-hope-for-salaries\"\u003eMy hope for salaries\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s been a wonderful journey of over a decade of transparent salaries, and I’m feeling energized by the significant step we’ve just taken to resolve debt and discrepancies in our approach and set us up with a more robust system that can serve us for years to come.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSomething that I’ve thought about a lot over the years is just how hard salaries are to do right. And also how important they are. People really care about not only what their salary is but the way that a company approaches salaries. From how different functions and roles are valued to whether there are disparities between pay to whether it is accepted (or even encouraged) to talk openly about compensation. I don’t think we’ve perfected it yet, and I don’t believe we ever will. But we’ve put a lot of time and energy into compensation because we believe it really matters.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a business and an individual focused on the long-term, I think a lot about what the future may hold for salaries within our industry. One of my hopes is that the work we do can make a positive difference to people and businesses. Could our salary system approach become adopted by others? Can we help others save time while also improving their compensation practices? Could businesses start to share openly how they adjust the market data to suit their unique circumstances? Could companies commit to having no exceptions or discrepancies in how they determine and set salaries? Can businesses commit to doing annual re-benchmarking and raising salaries for those who are now below market rates?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese are questions I don’t have all the answers to. We’ve seen progress in the past decade for salary transparency to become more widely adopted, but I believe that there is much more work to be done. I hope that our efforts and what we continue to share openly can have just a small impact in driving a movement towards transparent and equitable salaries.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eI want to give a very special thanks to \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenny-terry-b7749a44/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eJenny\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e, who was my key partner and driver of the work on our new Salary System, \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://hailley.start.page/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eHailley\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e and \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/carolynkopprasch/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eCaro\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e who helped brainstorm, review, and edit this article, and \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/martingloeckle/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eMartin\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e who helped with visual design. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

We believe that making these seemingly small improvements while resolving bugs can ultimately have a huge impact on the user experience, which is a big goal for our team at the moment.\u0026nbsp;But this week wasn’t just about bug fixes — this was about taking an opportunity to bring the whole engineering team together to improve how we work. We spent a week building better habits around releasing changes, improving our communication, and collaborating more closely with our Customer Advocacy team and each other.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"how-fixathon-worked\"\u003eHow Fixathon worked\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAhead of the Fixathon, we crafted a list of tasks for our team to work on quite carefully to ensure the risk of outages was as small as possible.\u0026nbsp;From there, we wrote up a set of guidelines for all of our engineers to jump right in once the Fixathon started.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/2024/01/Fixathon-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"848\" height=\"482\" srcset=\"https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/Fixathon-2.png 600w, https://buffer.com/resources/content/images/2024/01/Fixathon-2.png 848w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"to-start-we-opened-up-a-tool-called-bugsnag\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo start, we opened up a tool called Bugsnag\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eEach day started with our engineers engaging in Bugsnag, a tool designed for monitoring and managing automated error reports. The primary objective during this phase was to triage these automated error reports. Our team reviewed, categorized, and, where possible, resolved issues directly reported by Bugsnag, and our goal was to perform an action on at least 15 bug reports before moving to the next phase. This process was essential for understanding the state of our systems and possible problems in them - especially since we were guilty of not doing that on an ongoing basis earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"next-we-switched-to-product-bug-reports-and-resolved-them\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNext, we switched to product bug reports and resolved them\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter the morning spent triaging Bugsnag reports, our engineers shifted their focus to the product bugs some of them pre-selected earlier with the help from the product team. These were issues previously identified and logged in Jira. Engineers selected tasks in the areas they were familiar with and made sure to work on them safely, reviewing each other code and double-checking everything was done in a proper way to avoid any issues in this sensitive time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"we-then-kept-the-advocacy-team-in-the-loop\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe then kept the Advocacy team in the loop\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eA big part of the Fixathon was making sure our Advocacy team was aware of the changes we were making.

We learned how to better operate in Bugsnag as a team to reduce the numbers, we got better at collaborating with each other and Advocacy, and we gained visibility into many issues that otherwise would go unnoticed. We’re hoping this process stays with us, and we will clear new Bugsnag issues on an ongoing basis, making it easier for us to manage our bugs and notice them before our customers can do it!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe other part of Fixathon was fixing actual bugs! We resolved 44 tasks total, many of them small bugs we didn’t have time for earlier in the year. While most of them were so small that it’s hard to notice the change individually, all of them contribute to our vision of a consumer-grade experience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA few notable bugs we squashed included:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdding a billing page link to the account settings dropdown\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMaking “suggested media” scrollable\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLots of styling changes to make our margins and appearance consistent throughout the product\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a part of the Fixathon, we’re also close to releasing the “first comment” functionality for LinkedIn, which we already have for Instagram.

I think we're coming back around right now and getting to a really good place again. We're realizing how beneficial it is to be more interconnected.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, a Customer Advocate will do a much better job of delighting customers and solving their problems if, first, they connect with the rest of their team. They might discover that another Advocate has encountered similar issues before and learn how they solved them. Then, they might call on an Engineer or Product Manager, who will be able to share more about the system, maybe even how this may change as part of the roadmap for the future. That will give the Advocate so much more context and a deeper answer to the question.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo my advice is kind of two-in-one. Think about it as going beyond your job and team and connecting with others, but also going a layer deeper.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think it really relates to having an ownership mindset and thinking more holistically. ‘OK, what am I really trying to do here for the customer?

Async just means that a discussion happens when it is convenient for participants. For example, if I record a Loom video for a teammate in another time zone, they can watch it when they’re online — this is async communication at its best.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome remote companies are async first. A few are even fully async with no live calls or in-person time at all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, this isn’t what we’ve chosen for our culture. We aren’t an async-first company. There are many cases where discussing something synchronously (on a live video call) is the best solution for us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s more about our communication style at Buffer, and how async fits into it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"why-buffer-isn%E2%80%99t-an-async-first-company\"\u003eWhy Buffer isn’t an async-first company\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt comes down to this — there are some real benefits to synchronous communication. Through iterating over time, we feel we’ve found the right balance for synchronous and asynchronous communication for us during this current season of Buffer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSynchronous helps with moving quickly or complex problems\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen there are projects or situations that arise that either need to be resolved quickly or are quite complex and require input from several people, we’ve found it easier to jump on a Zoom call to hash it out. There’s nothing worse than being in one of those situations and waiting for someone to write back to you when you feel pressure at that moment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVideo calls help create connections in a remote team\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe love a long thread or a video update, but there is something about chatting via video that brings people slightly closer. (The same can be said about meeting up in person, which we still do as a remote company as well.) I’ve felt closer to many of my teammates after spending a few minutes talking about our pets, kids, or even the weather at the beginning of a call. It humanizes us and makes it easier to kick off that next conversation when we’re working on something together again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe also have many members of the team who haven’t met in person before, and the face-to-face reality of video calls and the ability to see facial expressions goes a long way in developing relationships. We work hard to make sure our tone is super clear in written communication, but there’s something about seeing someone’s face when you’re talking to them that can help you adjust while you're talking. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, a live call allows for conversation and real-time decision-making, problem-solving, and debating, something that async communication doesn’t allow to the same level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSometimes, items come up in sync conversations that someone wouldn’t write out or share async\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBeing in a live conversation is also just a different beast from writing updates or sharing a pre-recorded video. In live conversations, sometimes topics come up naturally that wouldn’t have otherwise, and it’s a great opportunity to talk over any more sensitive topics when all participants can hear each other’s tone of voice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"our-approach-and-philosophy-for-async-and-sync-at-buffer\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur approach and philosophy for async and sync at Buffer\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eTeammates are welcome to use their judgement about which tool to use depending on the needs of the communication, but here’s a cheat sheet that we share with teammates to help them choose:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf it’s four sentences or fewer, and/or it’s urgent, use Slack.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf it’s five sentences of more and/or it’s not timely, use Threads.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf it’s complex and it’s urgent, use Zoom or a phone call.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe tools we use for async communication\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen async communication is the path to go, we use a few different tools.

It’s great for having transparent cross-team communication, weighing decisions with several people, or sending longer updates.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA lot of teammates also use video tools like \u003ca href=\"https://zight.com/\"\u003eZight\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"https://www.loom.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"\u003eLoom\u003c/a\u003e to record videos and share updates that way if they prefer a video format.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGenerally, Slack is used for real-time discussion, but we’ve found that Slack can be an async tool as long as we’re clear with expectations that we are not expecting people to reply immediately unless we explicitly say so or it’s an urgent matter. (Read more about this in \u003ca href=\"https://buffer.com/resources/slack-agreements/\"\u003eour 10 Slack agreements\u003c/a\u003e.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur philosophy: we’re flexible\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUltimately, the idea for us is that we are a flexible team, and that includes how we meet and how we communicate. There are some meetings where I need to be up earlier or later to attend — I need to be flexible. At the same time, there’s so much inherent flexibility in my role at Buffer to create my schedule or hop on and offline when needed. We describe this as “give flexibility to get flexibility,” and it is a great summary of our approach to sync and async. Here’s how we describe it in our handbook:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003eWe try to be flexible with each other when possible. When teammates are able, we ask that they be willing to move a meeting, get up early, or stay on late to make it easier for another teammate to participate in a synchronous discussion. In exchange, they will offer the same courtesy to you. This means that we try to make ourselves available for standing or scheduled meetings even beyond the “typical” workday hours.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eNote that this does not mean that we expect teammates at their computers or available on Slack for all hours of the day. That’s rigidity, not flexibility. Batsirai, a former Bufferoo, summarized this well in \u003ca href=\"https://buffer.com/resources/buffer-diaries-batsirai/\"\u003ethis blog post\u003c/a\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cem\u003eBuffer emphasizes flexibility, so I do whatever it takes to get the job done, even if it means having late meetings with team members in different time zones. It’s about treating us like owners in the company, balancing work and personal life. We’re given great benefits and responsibility, and there’s a lot of trust placed in us. So, we give back by being dedicated and managing ourselves effectively.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eBuffer is a small team, and every person should feel ownership over their work and results — we believe that offering flexibility is the best way to have everyone at Buffer operate at their best level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"over-to-you\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOver to you\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe same might not be right for every company, but this is what works well for our global team.
