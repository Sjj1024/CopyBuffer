                                    "body": "\nHi there, \n\n\nJuly was another milestone month for Buffer, marked by record-breaking revenue, strong profitability, and exciting product updates. We posted our highest monthly profit in over four years and grew our cash balance back above $3M. Alongside these results, we launched [LinkedIn Profile Analytics](/24ea7f5a00fd803abf5dff6aa8dce947) and introduced a new Operator group to strengthen execution and keep our creative edge sharp.\n\n\nRead on for the July numbers, along with a few updates and what’s ahead.\n\n\n\u003e 📈 [MetricsTable]\n\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- _July’s $271K profit was higher than our total annual profit in any year since 2020, bringing year-to-date net income above $1M._\n- _Total revenue hit a record $1.91M, the highest in Buffer’s history._\n- _Our Bank balance climbed back above $3M, up $314K month-over-month._\n\n## Noteworthy Updates \u0026 Reflections\n\n\n**LinkedIn Profile Analytics**\n\n\nIn July, we launched LinkedIn Profile Analytics, giving users a simple way to see what is working with their personal LinkedIn posts. Until now, detailed analytics were mostly reserved for company Pages, yet many creators, freelancers, and small business owners build their audiences from personal profiles. We partnered directly with LinkedIn to become an official launch partner for their new Analytics API, making it possible to track post-level metrics like impressions, reactions, comments, shares, engagement rate, and video views. This launch strengthens our analytics offering and expands our appeal to the growing audience of professionals using LinkedIn to connect, share expertise, and grow their businesses.\n\n\n**Strengthening Operations to Fuel Strategic Growth**\n\n\nIn July, Joel announced the creation of a new Operator group to help us execute more effectively across teams and follow through on our strategy. This small group of senior operators from Product, Engineering, Marketing, Advocacy, and People will work together to clarify priorities, bring more consistency to our planning tools, and remove bottlenecks that slow us down, with a special focus on EPD operations. I’ll be leading the group in my role as VP of Finance \u0026 Operations, supporting operators across the company so we can move faster and with greater clarity.\n\n\nOur aim is to create a stronger bridge between strategy and execution, while giving Joel more space to lean into a builder and creator mindset. That means shaping vision, driving innovation, and making sure Buffer keeps the uniqueness that fuels both our current success and our future growth. As Joel [recently shared](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joelgascoigne_the-great-companies-are-the-ones-that-are-activity-7351621249275486210-iPjL?utm_source=share\u0026utm_medium=member_desktop\u0026rcm=ACoAAAlTkwsBuYSB9HzoEV3Fi5-8Fo-wwQk9txA), over-optimizing too soon can chip away at the very qualities that make a company stand out. The Operator group will help protect that creative edge while making sure our most important priorities are delivered with focus and momentum.\n\n\n**Legacy Migration Impact**\n\n\nIn July, we took an intentional $14,000 reduction to our MRR as part of our ongoing legacy migration work. We reached out to over 1,300 customers on older paid plans who have not been active for some time and let them know we would be proactively canceling their subscriptions at the upcoming renewal. No action was required on their part, and we reminded them they can continue using many of Buffer’s best features on our free plan.\n\n\nThis decision reflects our belief that honoring inactive customers and maintaining trust is more important than short-term gains. Starting with this group is a first step in a broader effort to responsibly steward our customer base while focusing on those actively using and benefiting from Buffer. While this change had a small short-term impact on growth, it positions us for a healthier, more engaged subscriber base over the long term.\n\n\n## **What’s Coming Up**\n\n\n**A New Way To Grow A** **Community** **With Buffer**\n\n\nWe’re hard at work on a new experience for replies and comments, which will replace our previous Engage feature and make it easier for creators and brands to connect with their audiences. The goal is twofold: to help aspiring and inconsistent creators build a habit of responding to comments, and to make sure users on both Free and Paid plans can easily manage replies and mentions. Tools for replies aren’t commonly available for free users and we’re eager to bridge that gap. \n\n\nAt launch, we’ll support comments for Threads, Bluesky, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Facebook. Our team is working towards early October as a launch date, and we’re excited about the potential this has to strengthen engagement for creators and brands across multiple channels.\n\n\nThank you for being a part of our journey and for your continued support. Feel free to reply if you have any thoughts or questions.\n\n\n-Jenny Terry, VP of Finance \u0026 Operations\n\n",

I’m looking forward to sharing the next couple of updates with you and keeping you closely connected to the milestones, progress, and plans shaping Buffer’s year.\n\n\n\u003e 📈 [MetricsTable]\n\n\n_Notes:_\n\n- _We closed June with $1.90M in MRR and $22.85M in ARR, up 22.9% year-over-year. We’ve now seen revenue grow every month for the past year._\n- _Our June profit was $177K, even after several one-time expenses and our mid-year salary benchmarking. This brings us to $756K in profit so far this year._\n- _Our EBITDA margin reached 10.2% which is the third time in the past four months we’ve been above the 10% mark._\n- _Despite a planned outflow of $743K to retire a promissory note and a few other one-time expenses, we ended June with only a $387K reduction in bank balance. Operating cash flow was over $300K (15.8%)._\n- _Free user activity continues to grow, with free MAU reaching 154,800 users though free-to-paid conversion is an area we’re looking to improve._\n\n## Note-worthy updates and reflections\n\n\n**LinkedIn Mentions are here**\n\n\nIn June, we launched one of our most requested features: the ability to @-mention personal profiles on LinkedIn directly from Buffer. [This update](https://suggestions.buffer.com/changelog/linkedin-mentions) brings us closer to parity with native LinkedIn posting and is a meaningful improvement for customers who rely on Buffer to tell more human, connected stories. Now, when scheduling a post to LinkedIn, users can simply type “@” and search from their existing connections, just as they would natively. There’s more we plan to build here, but this is a strong step forward in making workflows a little smoother.\n\n\n**Creator Camp is now hosted in Buffer**\n\n\nIn June, we kicked off a new round of [Creator Camp](https://buffer.com/resources/creator-camp-announcement/), our 30-day challenge to help creators build a consistent posting habit, and this time we brought the experience directly into Buffer. Using our new [Templates Library](https://suggestions.buffer.com/changelog/template-library) feature, prompts now appear right where you plan and schedule content in the Create space. It’s a small shift that makes Buffer feel even more like a true companion for creators.\n\n\nWe also introduced _Creator Camp Minis_, live 30-minute sessions focused on tackling the common roadblocks many creators face, from finding clarity around content pillars to building a workflow that sticks. Our [Discord community](https://buffer.com/community) continues to be the heartbeat of Camp, with creators showing up daily to share wins, swap feedback, and support one another.\n\n\nWith daily prompts, Streaks, Posting Goals, and a strong sense of community, Creator Camp is becoming a meaningful way for creators to find rhythm, stay motivated, and feel less alone in the process. We’re excited to keep evolving it from here.\n\n\n## What’s Coming Up\n\n\n**Refining the scheduling experience**\n\n\nWe’re in the midst of rolling out a revised scheduling experience in the Composer, shaped by several rounds of internal feedback and user input. This update brings clearer language and a more intuitive layout to the way posts are scheduled. These updates better reflect how customers think about posting, while still aligning with how Buffer works behind the scenes.\n\n\nWe’ve also extended this new design to all new post creation flows and added the ability for users to set their preferred scheduling behavior in Settings. This small touch helps Buffer feel more personal and efficient, especially for power users with established workflows.\n\n\nThe final step will be bringing this experience to post editing states, which is currently in progress. In parallel, we’re running a small A/B test with new signups to better understand how these changes support onboarding and posting habits. It’s another example of how we’re refining core parts of the product to feel more thoughtful, modern, and creator-friendly. \n\n\nThank you for being a part of our journey and for your continued support. Feel free to reply if you have any thoughts or questions.\n\n\n– Jenny, VP of Finance \u0026 Operations\n\n",

                                    "body": "\nHi there,\n\n\nThe month of May was a major milestone in Buffer’s journey. After more than 5 years, we officially reached a new all-time-high ARR. We’re seeing the compounding effects of our hard work these past few years and it’s incredible to imagine where we’ll go from here.\n\n\nRead on for the May results and my reflections on this milestone.\n\n\n\u003e 📈 [MetricsTable]\n\n\n_Notes:_\n\n- _We achieved a new all-time high of $22.4M in ARR, surpassing our previous peak from February 2020._\n- _We are currently seeing strong and accelerating growth in MRR/ARR and the number of paying customers. Notably, May was our second month with over 5,100 new paid customers._\n- _Monthly Active Users, which includes our free active users, is growing but not at the rate we’d like. We’re currently making efforts to increase our growth rate of MAU._\n- _We are continuing to see ARPU decline slightly, and this is an outcome we are happy about. Our current strategy is to primarily grow through acquisition and new customers, and these metrics are strong. This growth will give us future opportunities to drive ARPU growth if we choose to utilize that lever._\n- _Cash growth was exceptional, increasing by $463K and making this our strongest month since May 2019. We ended May with $3.26M in the bank._\n- _Total cash inflows were $1.88M, the fifth consecutive month above $1.8M, a threshold we hadn’t hit once since early 2020._\n- _Net income came in at $249K, our best result since August 2020, bringing YTD profit to $578K._\n\n## **Note-worthy updates and reflections**\n\n\n**A New All-Time-High ARR**\n\n\nOur previous all-time-high ARR was $22,384,598 on February 6, 2020 and on May 27th, 2025 we officially reached a new all-time-high ARR. This milestone has been 5 years in the making for us, and it's still sinking in for me personally. \n\n\nFrom our previous peak, we dropped 20% in ARR over 4 years to a low of $17,879,503 on January 7, 2024. It was a very nerve-racking situation to experience, and it took a monumental effort combining thoughtful strategy and diligent execution to turn it around.\n\n\nWhat I'm most proud of, is that the team here today is largely made up of people who dug in or joined to support Buffer as we worked through our most challenging chapter as a company. 51% of the team (38 of 74) experienced the last all-time-high on February 6, 2020. A further 27 folks joined us during our decline. This means that 91% of the current team joined before our recent growth phase that began in January 2024 .\n\n\nEach and every person at Buffer played a role in us reaching this new all-time-high ARR milestone. And it makes me very energized to think about what this team, having been through this experience, can build from here.\n\n\nWe're now officially in uncharted territory as a company. We have, by definition, never been here. I'm excited to keep going and see where this leads! And I think that defines this moment quite perfectly, because I believe that the way we'll discover how far we can take this company is by continuing to uncover our own path.\n\n\n**Template Library is Now Live**\n\n\nWe launched our Template Library for all Buffer users in May, and the early response has been really encouraging. This feature is designed to reduce the friction of getting started with content. We know how often people stare at a blank page, unsure of what to post. The Template Library helps by offering prompts and inspiration and an easy way for anyone to start writing a social media post. \n\n\nWhat I love about this launch is that the feature came directly from customer feedback. The earliest version was shaped by real struggles our community shared, and we’re already learning more now that it's live.\n\n\nThank you for being part of our journey and for your continued support. As always, feel free to reply if you have any thoughts or questions.\n\n\n– Joel, Founder CEO\n\n",

In April we achieved $22M in ARR and ended the month with our 12th company retreat. We’ve recently been hitting our stride and we’re building Buffer with greater clarity, tighter alignment, and a deeper sense of purpose around serving creators and small businesses. Read on for the April numbers and my reflections. \n\n\n\u003e 📈 [MetricsTable]\n\n\n_Notes:_\n\n- _April was our second-highest month ever for new paid customers, with over 5,410 new subscriptions._\n- _Our strong results in MRR, Customer and MAU growth while seeing ARPU slightly decline show that we are succeeding in growing primarily by serving and gaining more customers. This is a key part of our strategy we have been working towards realizing._\n- _You might notice cash balance has declined, this was due to a share repurchase which I share more about below._\n- _We closed April with a net loss of $33,656. This was expected due to our annual team retreat expenses._ _It’s worth noting that last year, in the month we had our retreat, we saw a loss of $262,577. The significantly reduced loss while retreat costs have remained roughly constant shows our strong profitability in 2025._\n- _Year-to-date profit is strong at $329,259. We expect to be profitable on a monthly basis for the rest of 2025._\n\n## Note-worthy updates and reflections\n\n\n**Annual Retreat in Türkiye**\n\n\nIn April, we held our 12th company retreat, this time in Antalya, Türkiye. Fifty-one weeks of the year, we work together across 49 cities in 21 countries. To get to spend a week in the same place is very special, and this retreat hit a particularly high note of how tight-knit, high trust and effective this team feels right now. Our results speak to how well this team is operating, and while we were spending the week together we celebrated a new milestone of crossing $22M in ARR. The themes I had in mind for this retreat were connection, celebration, and collaboration and I believe it checked all of those boxes and more. We're all returning home with full hearts, greater alignment, and fresh energy to take Buffer to entirely new heights together.\n\n\n**Celebrating $22M ARR Milestone**\n\n\nWe had the fortunate timing that we crossed $22M in ARR while at retreat, and so we [celebrated in person in Türkiye](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bufferapp_we-reached-an-incredible-milestone-together-ugcPost-7324043939710181376-jDuv?utm_source=share\u0026utm_medium=member_desktop\u0026rcm=ACoAAAevZXUBKZcgv5oOr1AnNcqJ1Den7mVd3Fc). For context, it took us seven months to go from $18M to $19M, four months to go from $19M to $20M, two and a half months to reach $21M, and now we’ve achieved $22M two months later. Around the same time we reached a new ARR milestone, we crossed 20% YoY growth in ARR/MRR. This is a very strong growth rate and a significant milestone for the team, especially given that our profit margin sits at around 10% most months. We’re also fast-approaching Buffer’s highest ARR to date and I expect to be sharing that celebration with you all soon.\n\n\n**Coming up on our Roadmap**\n\n\nWe have two key initiatives which have been longer projects and are starting to reach significant milestones. The first is Community, our rebuilt engagement tool. This will allow users to manage and engage with comments and mentions across platforms, build their community/audience, and seamlessly create new content through the process of responding to comments. Second is a new Public API, which will allow users and 3rd party developers to build powerful new functionality to integrate more seamlessly with Buffer. Both of these have recently gone into Alpha, which is our internal testing step. In the coming months we will move them both to the Beta phase where we start working closely with customers to shape and refine them towards full launch.\n\n\n**Cash Balance impacted by Share Repurchase**\n\n\nOur cash balance declined by ~$1M in April due to a strategic repurchase of shares from our largest investor. We repurchased roughly 9% of the company through this transaction, and the move aligns with our long-term approach to sustainable ownership and simplifying our cap table. Our return to growth and profitability has been defined by going our own unique path, going down-market to serve customers and taking a long-term mindset. To continue this path, we are intentionally managing ownership of Buffer so that we do not have short term growth pressure. In the long-term, we are confident our strategy will lead to compounding strong results. Despite this one-time transaction, we continue to maintain a healthy cash position and are on a steady path to rebuild our bank balance over the coming months.  The repurchase was structured as one payment now, and the rest converted to a promissory note (i.e. debt). We expect to make a second repayment within the next 12 months.\n\n\nThank you for being part of our journey and for your continued support. As always, reply if there’s anything on your mind.\n\n\n– Joel, Founder CEO\n\n",

Read on for Buffer’s March update and my Q1 reflection.\n\n\n\u003e 📈 [MetricsTable]\n\n\n_Notes_:\n\n- _Signups exceeded 100,000 for the sixth month in a row, and activations remained consistently above 50,000 per month._\n- _We achieved $179K in net profit for the month, making March our twelfth consecutive month of profitability._\n- _We ended March with a cash balance of $3.88M, a $344K MoM increase._\n- _Thanks to our strong results in March, we've crossed $300k in revenue per team member for the first time._\n\n## Note-worthy updates and reflections\n\n\n**Weekly Posting Goals**\n\n\nAfter a successful beta period in February, we rolled out Weekly Posting Goals to all users in mid-March. This feature is all about helping people stay consistent with their social posting habits — offering default goals of 1, 3, or 5 posts per week per channel, with the option to customize even further. It’s a small but meaningful way we’re encouraging progress over perfection. So far, adoption has been strong. \n\n\n**Content Feeds**\n\n\nWe released [**Feeds**](https://buffer.com/resources/introducing-feeds/) in March, a new feature that lets users bring in posts from their favorite blogs, newsletters, YouTube channels, and more right into Buffer. The goal is to assist our users with having plenty of ongoing content inspiration and ideas. Early feedback has been really positive. Customers have shared how much they appreciate having a smoother, more inspiring way to fill their content calendar. This is another step in our ongoing effort to build tools that feel thoughtful, approachable, and especially helpful for creators and small businesses.\n\n\n**Buffer’s Upcoming Retreat** \n\n\nAt the end of April, the Buffer team is coming together for an all-company working retreat in Türkiye. Our last retreat in 2024 was in Cancun, Mexico, and it was our first retreat in 6 years. This time around, the Buffer team has already built up valuable in person relationships. Our retreats are invaluable opportunities for us to continue connecting and aligning on our strategy and where we are going in the coming months and years. I’ll look forward to sharing an update after the retreat is finished. We’ll also be posting live retreat updates from teammates across Buffer on our [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/buffer) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bufferapp/) if you’d like to follow along more closely. \n\n\n**Parenting Alongside Building Buffer** \n\n\nI recently [shared a post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joelgascoigne_ive-been-having-a-fairly-profound-shift-activity-7309796603349897217-HG6q?utm_source=share\u0026utm_medium=member_desktop\u0026rcm=ACoAAAevZXUBKZcgv5oOr1AnNcqJ1Den7mVd3Fc) about how becoming a dad has impacted my motivation and purpose. It’s an open reflection on the profound shift of a new and strong purpose in being a parent. This hasn't diminished the ambition I have for Buffer. In fact, my ambition for what I can achieve for Buffer and my clarity of the potential Buffer has for future impact and growth has significantly increased since becoming a dad. I became a parent in 2021, at a point of the Buffer journey where we were in the midst of decline. It was nerve-racking to become a parent at a time when the company I started more than 10 years earlier was in a bad place. It took a lot of soul searching and then a few years of intentional strategy changes and strong execution to get us back to growth and profitability in 2024. We're now better placed than we've ever been in the Buffer journey. \n\n\n**Q1 Reflection**\n\n\nWe ended Q1 2025 with $1,791,227 in MRR ($21,494,729 ARR). This represents 6.74% growth from Q4 2024, which is our strongest quarterly growth since Q2 2018, and our second strongest quarter in our entire 14+ year journey. We also grew paying customers by 6.8% to 64,273, our strongest growth since Q3 2016. We closed the quarter with $362,916 in profit, so we are in a strong position of being well resourced for this next phase of our journey.\n\n\nThis is our 5th consecutive quarter of MRR/ARR growth and 3rd consecutive quarter of paying customer growth. We're celebrating this growth after 4 years of decline, and at the same time reflecting on what got us back into a strong position, and how that can inform how we can continue our strong results long into the future.\n\n\nOur return to growth started with a reminder of why we do what we do. We’re here to support the aspiring entrepreneurs, the inconsistent creators, and the budding small businesses. These are the folks who inspire us every day, and we’re committed to building the tools and company that truly serve them.\n\n\nWe returned to growth through the clarity of who we're serving, and finding the ways to provide value to them that puts us in a more differentiated position in the market. We now have the luxury of profitability alongside ownership and control of the company that enables us to be truly mission driven. We can genuinely serve our customers, and by doing so, go further than others who have external pressures may be able to. We believe this will enable us to continue carving out our own unique spot in the market and drive sustained results.\n\n\nThank you for reading and for your continued support!\n\n\n– Joel, Founder CEO\n\n",

Having clear goals enables users to set a target and build a posting schedule around it to support a deeper habit formation opportunity for our users. We’re looking forward to releasing this to more users in the coming months.\n\n\n**Evolving Comments**\n\n\nOur product team has been reimagining how responding to comments works within Buffer, bringing a major upgrade to what is currently our Engage tool. The goal is to help users respond to comments more seamlessly. We know that people can rapidly build their community and audience by promptly responding to the comments their posts receive, and we know that algorithms reward this by weighting those posts more highly in the feed. The first iteration will be focused on Threads, a channel we’ve seen a lot of interest in and a partner that has been actively working on their API. We’re looking forward to sharing more in the coming months. [See the design previews on Threads here.](https://www.threads.net/@buffer/post/DGyxyz-tUvf?xmt=AQGzG3sTUeAExL2KEnl74NSh2iBmsBwoJxQI8m5JhAJEhA)\n\n\n**Ongoing Brand Refresh**\n\n\nOur design team continues to refine and elevate the Buffer experience — from product UI to the website and email design. The most recent update is [the Buffer homepage](https://buffer.com/), which is a great example of the fresh direction we’re heading visually.\n\n\n**Adopting Linear Company-Wide**\n\n\nIn February, we officially adopted Linear as our organization-wide project management tool. After months of thoughtful bottom-up and top-down evaluation, we made the call to fully replace Jira and consolidate around a single, modern tool. Linear is quickly becoming a foundational part of how we operate, and early feedback from the team has been overwhelmingly positive. It’s already helping us move faster, stay aligned, and ship with more clarity.\n\n\nThank you for reading and for your continued support.\n\n\n– Joel, Founder CEO\n\n",

[Read more about our 2024 profit share here.](https://buffer.com/resources/2024-profit-share/)\n\n\n**Doubling Down on Our Down-And-Wide Strategy**\n\n\nWe reached all-time highs in signups and activations in January. Analyzing the growth, we believe this surge is the result of doubling down on our down-and-wide strategy, coupled with a few key drivers:\n\n- Blog-driven signups increased 9% thanks to refreshed, high-performing content\n- Paid marketing hit a record in customer acquisition while maintaining efficient cost-of-acquisition\n- January’s usual SaaS momentum brought fresh energy and new goals\n\nThese results signal to our team that our focused investment in acquisition and product quality has been effective, and will continue to yield results for us long-term.\n\n\n**New Feature:** **Streaks**\n\n\nIn January we launched Streaks, a feature to help customers build consistent posting habits. Post at least once a week to build up a streak; miss a week and your streak resets. Consistency is the foundation of success on social media, and Streaks is one step towards supporting Buffer users with that key element of their social strategy. Streaks is already driving engagement, and we’re excited to build on it in the months ahead. We're seeing early signs that Streaks leads to better results for our customers and ultimately for Buffer through increased retention. [Read more about Streaks here.](https://buffer.com/resources/build-a-consistent-posting-habit-with-streaks/)\n\n\n**Platform Opportunity: Reintroducing the Public API**\n\n\nIn January, the product team began early work on a reimagined public API,a foundational step toward expanding Buffer as a platform. With 170k+ MAU, 60k+ paying customers and strong growth, we believe that we are well positioned to expand Buffer into a platform customers and developers can build upon. \n\n\nOur Platform vision will allow us to keep the core product simple while offering power users the flexibility to tailor Buffer to their needs—covering use cases we haven’t even imagined yet. Much like our ongoing \"Consumer Grade UX (CGX)\" initiative, this work will push us to modernize Buffer’s architecture, prioritize performance, and embrace a platform mindset. By building alongside our community, we can do more with a small team and unlock the potential of our broader ecosystem.\n\n\n**No More Burn Rate**\n\n\nFor the first time in years, we no longer have a burn rate at Buffer. We closed out January profitable, growing and holding more cash than we did in January 2024. We’ve officially closed the chapter on runway tracking and are firmly on the path of long-term, sustainable growth.\n\n\nThank you for being part of our journey and for your continued support.

Hit reply and let me know any questions you have. Thank you for your support throughout 2024!\n\n\n\u003e 📈 [MetricsTable]\n\n\n_Notes:_\n\n- _December was our second consecutive month exceeding $100,000 in profit._\n- _In December, new paying customers surpassed 3,900, contributing to $83,259 in new business MRR—our second-highest month ever for this metric._\n- _After losses in both 2022 and 2023, we are proud to close 2024 with a net profit of $202,000 and total revenue of $18.6M._\n\n## Note-worthy updates and reflections\n\n\n**EPD Strategy \u0026 Structure Adjustments**\n\n\nThroughout November and December I worked closely with our PMs to refine our product strategy and adjust our Engineering, Product, Design (EPD) team structure and scopes of ownership to align with our strategy.\n\n\nThrough these changes, we have re-committed to developing our Engagement and Analytics tools alongside our Publishing and Content Creation tools. Additionally, we're building out a platform so that others will be able to build on top of Buffer, and so that Buffer is well-positioned in this new world where AI is a core utility both for productivity and building new products.\n\n\nIn everything we build, we are continuing to pursue our down-and-wide strategy to serve creators, entrepreneurs and small businesses. I’m genuinely excited about what’s ahead—it feels like one of the most focused and impactful roadmaps we’ve developed in years, with clear priorities and meaningful value additions to the product.\n\n\n**Bluesky Video Scheduling**\n\n\nWe added video support for Bluesky, which enables users to schedule videos up to 60 seconds long. This is compatible with other channels that support video, which makes it super easy to use Buffer for cross-posting videos.\n\n\n**Schedule AI Images with Image Playground**\n\n\nWe added Apple Intelligence Image Playground integration to our iOS app. This allows users to utilize the native AI image creation tools in iOS to seamlessly add images to their posts. It's like having a creative assistant that can turn your ideas into graphics in seconds, and is especially useful since we've found time and time again that including an image in your post can improve results.\n\n\n## 2024 Summary\n\n\nWe concluded 2024 with growth across all of our metrics:\n\n- ARR grew 12.57% YoY to $20,129,149\n- Paying Customers grew 7.6% YoY to 60,184\n- Monthly Active Users grew 29.6% to 180,647\n- Average Revenue Per User grew 4.66% YoY to $27.87\n- Revenue per Employee grew 18.3% to $275,707\n- Net Profit grew 135.3% to $202,459\n\nStay tuned for my second annual shareholder letter which I'll be writing in the next couple of months with many more details on how 2024 looked for Buffer.\n\n\nThanks for your continued support!\n\n\n– Joel, Founder CEO\n\n",

We’re on a strong trajectory to close 2024 with an overall profit._\n- _All of these numbers point to us having re-established strong mechanics for our business, and we're working hard to build on these great results to make this chapter of growth and profitability long-lasting_\n\n## Note-worthy updates and reflections\n\n\n**Signups**\n\n\nIn October, we surpassed 110,000 monthly signups for the first time since March 2019. This is an incredible milestone, especially given that we achieved it during a period we typically see seasonal demand decline. Our continuous efforts in content marketing and organic search optimization have been instrumental in driving this growth.\n\n\n**Threads now supports up to 20 images**\n\n\nWe support many different social channels, and we make it a priority to stay on top of API changes and new functionality. As part of this effort, we recently addd support for 20 images in Threads.\n\n\n**Deep Work Quarter**\n\n\nFor the rest of the year, we’re running an experiment called **Deep Work Quarter** at Buffer. Here’s how it’s structured:\n\n- All recurring group meetings have been removed\n- 1:1s are now set to a monthly cadence\n- The focus is on clearing calendars and embracing a new way of working\n\nWe’ve shifted to long-form asynchronous communication to drive transparent, collaborative discussions. By shifting away from agenda-filled recurring meetings, we make room for ad-hoc single topic focused meetings when needed to unblock us and move fast, while also creating space for no-agenda happy hours, games, and casual chats to maintain strong team connections. We’re already seeing the benefits of uninterrupted time for deep work.\n\n\n**Looking ahead to 2025**\n\n\nOur turnaround journey has centered on strengthening our differentiation by doubling down on key growth drivers: a freemium model to support entrepreneurs and creators, in-house content marketing with increased SEO investment, product simplification, improved UX, renewing our focus on the customer, and reinforcing our unique culture. As we near the end of 2024, I’ve been spending time stepping back to reflect on the greater strategy, to better align our roadmaps across various areas with strategic goals. I'm feeling a level of clarity I have not experienced before of the size of opportunity that exists for Buffer in the coming years. I'm working closely with leadership to finalize the strategy and roadmaps, which is leading to ensuring we're structured and resourced to take advantage of the opportunity and reach our full potential. Once we've made our plans, I am energized to work in the details work all teams to achieve the best possible execution and attention to detail we can.\n\n\nThat's all for October. As a final note, be sure to check out Bluesky if you have not yet had a chance to. It's a special new social platform ([read my reflections on what makes it different](https://buffer.com/resources/bluesky-decentralized/)); one that's seeing some incredible growth right now, and one which we've been early in supporting. Here's a [starter pack](https://bsky.app/starter-pack/buffer.com/3lbcvfmw7bv2x) - a super easy way to join and follow the Buffer team too.\n\n\nHave a great week,\n\n\nJoel, Founder CEO\n\n",

It's been a journey, to say the least. We first crossed $19M in ARR in September 2018. It's hard to believe that's six years ago.\n\n\nTo be declining for multiple years is demoralizing and exhausting. But I always planned to build a long-term business and was determined to lead us back to thriving, so I remained optimistic despite the fact it took some searching to find the path to new growth. The first time we crossed $19M, the writing was on the wall for our looming decline. Pace of product improvement and innovation had stalled; we were debilitated by tech debt we didn't yet know how to manage. We succumbed to squeezing revenue out of existing customers, and were already seeing a steep decline in new paying customers.\n\n\nThis time around, we are moving faster and more boldly than we have in years, and we've re-centered ourselves around growing by serving more customers and continually adding real value, rather than through price increases and short-term growth hacks. There's no doubt we will run into challenging cycles again in our future. I'm confident we'll find our way through those too. To me, that's a natural part of building a long-term business. From here – onwards to $20M, again.\n\n\n**Schedule threaded posts to Mastodon**\n\n\nThe default character limit for most Mastodon servers is 500 characters. Now you can schedule longer posts using Buffer by breaking them up into threaded posts.\n\n\n**New scheduling options for TikTok and YouTube Shorts**\n\n\nWe've added more flexibility for scheduling TikTok and YouTube Shorts posts with our new \"Notify Me\" publishing option. Now, you can easily switch between automatic publishing and notification publishing for each TikTok or YouTube Shorts video you schedule.\n\n\n**Share images to TikTok**\n\n\nNow you can schedule static images to your TikTok account.\n\n\n## Q3 2024 Reflection\n\n\nWe ended Q3 2024 with $1,602,052 in MRR or $19,224,628 in ARR. This represents 3.46% growth from Q2, which is our strongest quarterly growth in almost 5 years. We also grew paying customers by 2.89% to 57,666, our strongest growth in over 6 years. We continued our trend from Q2 of profitability in each month of Q3, and achieved a net income of $125,289 for the quarter.\n\n\nSegmenting out Legacy and New Buffer customers, we can understand the numbers and trajectory in higher definition. New Buffer now represents 83.2% of total MRR, and 80.2% of paying customers. We saw an MRR/ARR growth rate for the New Buffer segment of 7.82% for Q3.\n\n\nThe delta between our 7.82% growth rate for New Buffer vs our overall growth rate of 3.46% shows that we have a strong foundation of growth in our current and majority customer segment. In Q3 we added $83,427 in net MRR growth for New Buffer, with $12,861 (15.4%) of this coming from Legacy customers migrating over to our New Buffer plans, while Legacy Buffer as a segment declined by $30,259 in net MRR. This indicates that we will continue to see strong overall growth rates going forward.\n\n\nThe Legacy segment continues to decline as we are not adding any new customers to it, and it has a natural churn rate. In Q3 the Legacy segment declined by 13.81% to $268,974 in MRR or $3,227,693 in ARR. We are happily tracking the decline without aggressively forcing customers to migrate to New Buffer plans. Eventually we will aim to get this segment to zero, which will enable simplicity in our product, architecture and customer service.\n\n\nI predicted in my Q2 update that Q3 would be the quarter we see an overall increase in the number of paying customers once again. We are celebrating achieving this, and looking ahead to how we can continue to achieve strong growth in both the number of paying customers and MRR/ARR so that we can see many more strong growth quarters ahead. I expect we will see a strong Q4 despite the usual seasonal dip in usage of our product during the holidays, thanks to a continued strong growth rate of New Buffer and the lessening pull down effect of Legacy as the segment declines.\n\n\nThanks for your continued support!\n\n\nJoel, Founder CEO\n\n",

Send me a reply if there’s anything here that catches your eye, or you have reflections or questions on.\n\n\n\u003e 📈 [MetricsTable]\n\n\n_Notes:_\n\n- _In August, we briefly surpassed $19M in MRR for the first time since April 2022, achieving a significant milestone. Our August revenue also reached its highest level since April 2022. While we closed the month just shy of $19M MRR, early September results have already pushed us past $19.1M._\n- _We're very happy with the current pace of growth in MRR/ARR and number of paying customers, while we also have a clear strategy and roadmap to maintain and even increase this pace of growth._\n- _The past few months have been particularly significant as we've achieved the 'holy grail' of growth we've been striving for: increasing our number of paying customers and, in turn, serving more people. We’ve achieved our eighth consecutive month of growth alongside our 5th consecutive month of profitability._\n- _Growing Monthly Active Users is now something we're putting a lot of focus on. Despite our turnaround and growth across other metrics, MAU has remained relatively flat for the last two years. We have a number of opportunities in mind to start to significantly grow this number, which is an important early indicator to continued growth of paying customers._\n- _Our net income for August was impacted by a large severance payment, however our general baseline going forward should be between $50-$100k in monthly profit._\n\n## Note-worthy updates and reflections\n\n\n**Signups**\n\n\nIn August, we achieved a significant milestone with 99,000 signups, making it our best month for signup performance in over four years. This growth was fueled by improvements in organic search, optimized paid marketing efforts, and increased brand awareness from launches such as Threads and Bluesky. These combined initiatives effectively attracted a surge of new users.\n\n\n**Twitter / 𝕏 Long Form Posts**\n\n\nTwitter (now 𝕏) was the first platform Buffer supported, and it remains a powerful tool for many of our users. We're excited to announce that Buffer now supports longer-form content—up to 25,000 characters—empowering users to express their creativity in the most intuitive and natural way. This is available to all users with a Premium 𝕏 account.\n\n\n**Threaded posts and content warnings for Mastodon**\n\n\nThe default character limit for most Mastodon servers is 500 characters. Now you can schedule longer posts with Buffer by breaking them up into threaded posts. With this update, we now offer threaded posts functionality for all the key short-form text focused social networks: 𝕏, Threads, Mastodon and Bluesky. We've also added the ability to use Content Warnings on Mastodon, which allow you to hide the content of a post behind a warning. This can be useful for spoilers, upsetting news, trigger warnings, and more. Threaded posts and Content Warnings were our top 2 feature requests on our suggestions board for Mastodon, and adding them is part of our overall push to improve how helpful Buffer is for text-first and decentralized social networks.\n\n\nThat’s it for August. I’ll be back in touch in a couple of weeks to share our September results. In the meantime, please hit reply with any questions or comments.\n\n\nThanks for your continued support!\n\n\nJoel, Founder CEO\n\n",

This works via our reminder notifications system, which does not allow for fully automated posting, but can significantly help in planning and consistency. Instagram Personal Profiles already account for 50% of Instagram channels connected, and has been a significant contributor to the 81% increase in overall Instagram channels connected.\n\n\n**Bluesky Growth**\n\n\nBluesky is currently our fastest-growing channel, with channel connections increasing by 151% over the past 30 days. We've also launched video and GIF publishing support for Bluesky, enabling users to upload up to 25 videos per day (or a total of 10 GB).\n\n\n**Startup CEO Show Podcast Interview**\n\n\nI recently joined [Mark MacLeod](https://www.linkedin.com/in/themarkmacleod/) on his podcast The Startup CEO Show. It was a pleasure to share the journey of building Buffer and discuss the values and principles that guide me in leading the company. You can check out the full podcast [here](https://go.joel.is/RveS4qQ).\n\n\n**Closing out 2024**\n\n\nNovember marked 14 years since I launched Buffer from my apartment in Birmingham, UK. What started as a simple tool to help people Tweet consistently has grown into a business supporting 11 social channels, serving 60,000 customers, providing meaningful work for 72 team members and generating $1.65M in monthly revenue.\n\n\nOver the years, I’ve been reflecting that Buffer has evolved through three key eras:\n\n- **Early Traction** – Building swiftly, fostering a unique community, and pioneering remote work and building in public.\n- **Growing Pains** – Navigating challenges, rediscovering purpose, and cementing independence for long-term success.\n- **Renewed Focus** – With a clear strategy and bold moves, we’ve turned around a multi-year decline, achieving 12%+ growth this year and on track for a profitable 2024.\n\n[→ Read my full reflection on 14 years of Buffer](https://joel.is/fourteen/)\n\n\nLooking ahead, we remain focused on empowering entrepreneurs, creators, and small businesses to grow and thrive. The next horizon feels clearer than ever, and we’re energized for what’s to come.\n\n\nThanks for your support in 2024!\n\n\n– Joel, Founder CEO\n\n",

We also continue to see steady MRR growth._\n- _We're now seeing our paying customers increase consistently. This was a metric which was lagging back the growth we've been seeing in MRR/ARR. It's wonderful to now be exactly where we want to be: growing ARR through serving more customers._\n- _As we enter a new phase of growth, I'm reflecting a lot on how we can keep our growth momentum continuing, while remaining a lean team. In this way, we will see fairly rapid growth in our profit margin and our bank balance will continue to rebound._\n- _We're also currently considering more stock repurchases from longer term investors and alumni who are ready for liquidity and where we see a win-win opportunity in the share price. Depending on the extent to which we conduct buybacks, this will result in a drop in the short term to our cash balance._\n\n## Note-worthy updates and reflections\n\n\n**Bluesky Launch**\nAt the end of July we launched support for Bluesky within Buffer. We believe Bluesky is a significant step forward in the era of decentralized social media, and we’re thrilled to partner with them to make scheduling and cross-posting even easier for our customers. Users can now effortlessly create, plan, and schedule Bluesky posts in advance, complete with links, images, hashtags, and even threaded posts. Decentralized social has brought a new era of text-first networks—an area that has always been our strength. [Read more of my reflections on Bluesky and decentralized social.](https://joel.is/bluesky/)\n\n\n**Analytics for LinkedIn personal profiles**\nAnalytics are now available for LinkedIn personal profiles connected to Buffer. Users can simply head to the Publishing tab and view their sent posts to see the number of likes and comments on their LinkedIn content.  We've added a lot of power and insights to the sent posts tab in recent months. We're also reflecting as a product team on the distinction between analytics within our Publish and Analyze tools, as we have some discrepancies and confusion we create there.\n\n\n**SOC2 Compliance**\nIn July, we made SOC2 compliance a top priority after one of our social network partners flagged it as a requirement to be fulfilled within six months. Since then, the team has been diligently coordinating efforts and organizing the necessary work. Our goal is to complete this by the end of the year. Achieving SOC2 compliance is a valuable step towards being a more mature business and serving a wider range of customers. We're balancing this enhanced diligence with ensuring we continue to ship improvements regularly.\n\n\n**A change to Product team structure**\nAfter nearly four years, we parted ways with our Chief Product Officer. While this marks a significant change, it also gets me closer to the product org, and presents an opportunity for the team and I to re-evaluate and refresh our product strategy and roadmap. We’re rallying around three central pillars: empowering users to build lasting habits around content creation and sharing, leveraging text as our core strength, and accelerating modernizing the product by paying down tech debt and improving UX.\n\n\n**Marketing performance**\nEarlier this year, we started noticing a significant decline in page views on our blog, likely due to changes in Google's algorithm. However, through a dedicated focus on SEO and a refined editorial strategy, we not only recovered but also have seen remarkable growth. As a result, our blog traffic has reached levels not seen since 2018, and in July, we surpassed 1 million page views.\n\n\nThat’s it for July. I’ll be back in touch in a week or two to share our August results. In the meantime, please hit reply with any questions or comments.\n\n\nHave a great week,\n\n\nJoel, Founder CEO\n\n",

We launched this integration on June 25 with the goal of helping users kickstart meaningful conversations and grow their following on Threads with planning, scheduling, and analytics tools. was our top feature request by far, and we were thrilled to provide this value promptly after Threads made their API available. As of the end of June, this resulted in 4,340 Threads channels connected to Buffer, 51,000 posts created, and 323 subscription upgrades. [Read more](https://buffer.com/resources/buffers-threads-integration/)\n\n\n**Duplicate Action**\n\n\nOn June 19, we launched the Duplicate Action to 100% of customers. With this new action, customers are able to duplicate posts in any state (e.g in the queue, in drafts or in sent posts) creating even greater flexibility when sharing content across different social networks. Outside of new channel requests this has been a highly requested feature so we’re excited to add it to Buffer and make the content creation process even easier for our users. [Read more](https://support.buffer.com/article/660-share-posts-with-the-duplicate-feature)\n\n\n**Profitability**\n\n\nJune marked our third straight month of profitability in 2024. This brings our Net Income, YTD, to a loss of $202,000 down from $269,000 reported in May. Gaining and growing paid subscribers will continue to be a core focus of ours as we make our way back to profitability.\n\n\n## Q2 2024 Reflection\n\n\nQ2 2024 was another strong quarter for the year and has contributed to the continued growth trajectory and return to profitability. We finished the quarter with a 1.94% increase in MRR/ARR, ending with $1,548,398 MRR, or $18,580,777 ARR. We saw a slight 0.08% decline in the number of paying customers, to 56,042. With our continued growth, we achieved profitability in each month in Q2, with net income of $217,354 for the quarter.\n\n\nSegmenting out our Legacy and New Buffer segments tells a more complete story of the overall numbers. As a reminder, the New Buffer segment represents our new per-channel based pricing which we introduced in mid-2021. The New Buffer segment represented 79.8% of MRR and 76.4% of paying customers as of the end of Q2. New Buffer growth has been strong for Q2, with 7.48% growth in MRR/ARR and 5.96% growth in paying customers.\n\n\nThe Legacy segment continues to decline, as we are not adding any customers to the segment and churn continues to play out. Of the $68,685 net MRR increase in Q2 for the New Buffer segment, $17,424 (25.3%) of that increase was attributed to customers migrating over from the Legacy segment.\n\n\nGiven the much stronger growth in New Buffer compared to our overall numbers, we will likely see an acceleration of our growth throughout the rest of 2024 as the Legacy segment has a diminishing pull-down impact on our numbers. We will eventually see a reduction in New Buffer's net MRR growth due to the lack of migrations from Legacy, however we will see a greater positive impact to MRR as a result of the diminishing net MRR decrease from the Legacy segment. Net MRR decrease for the Legacy segment was $39,203, a reduction from $47,233 net MRR decrease in Q1.\n\n\nLooking ahead to Q3, we see multiple opportunities to increase our MRR growth rate, and we also expect that this can be the quarter where we see an overall increase in paying customers again, as the increase in paying customers for the New Buffer segment outpaces the loss of paying customers from the Legacy segment. We are also starting to reflect on the end of our journey from Legacy to New Buffer, and putting a clear strategy in place for strong continued growth for the New Buffer segment as it starts to represent our growth overall.\n\n\nThat’s it for June. I’ll be back in touch in a couple of weeks to share our July results. In the meantime, please hit reply with any questions or comments.\n\n\nThanks for your continued support!\n\n\nJoel, Founder CEO\n\n",

I’m happy to take any questions or comments while Joel is away on family leave. For the past two consecutive months, we have successfully closed with a profit.

In April, we introduced new downgrade logic, and May marked the first full month with this new system in place. One significant factor behind the increased revenue is the elimination of credits for unused time when customers downgrade their subscriptions mid-term. Additionally, our total operating expenses (OPEX) reached their lowest level since early 2020. This reduction in OPEX is attributed to six current open roles on the team, which include five backfills for recently departed team members and a new role for a marketing automation manager.

Users can now use Buffer to schedule your video content for Facebook Stories, Instagram Stories and Reels, YouTube Shorts, and TikTok in just a couple of clicks.\n\n\n**Improved Channel Connection Flow**\n\n\nOur goal was to achieve reliability and consistency in our channel connection flows. This project originated due to discrepancies in how channel connections operated in Onboarding compared to the Account app, as well as between web and mobile apps. With the refactored code, we now have a unified and consistent approach across all implementations and channels, resulting in significantly fewer bugs, reduced re-work, and simplified bug-hunting. This refactor also lowers the time and effort needed to implement new API-based channels. Additionally, we saw this project as an opportunity to enhance the user experience across various channel connection interfaces. Our event and error tracking fidelity has greatly improved, making it easier to identify issues and opportunities at every stage of the connection flow.\n\n\n**Team wide performance reviews**\n\n\nIn May, we kicked off our semi-annual performance review cycle. This included self-reviews, manager reviews,  and “up” reviews where teammates were asked to share feedback with their managers.\n\n\n**Team Wide Support Time (TWST)**\n\n\nFollowing an incredible team-wide support session during our March retreat, we decided to incorporate this experience into our regular work routines. The aim of Team Wide Support Time is to bring the team closer to our customers, foster a deeper understanding of their needs and pain points, and strengthen our relationships with users. We kicked off our first TWST in May and the team agreed that it built off of the momentum from our retreat really nicely.\n\n\n**Coming Up: Product Launches**\n\n- Bluesky scheduling\n- Threads scheduling\n- LinkedIn personal profile analytics\n\n**Profitability**\n\n\nAs I mentioned above, May marks our second straight month of profitability in 2024. This brings our Net Income, YTD, to a loss of $269,000. Gaining and growing paid subscribers will continue to be a core focus of ours as we make our way back to profitability\n\n\nThat’s it for May. We’ll be back in touch in July to share our June results. In the meantime, please feel free to reach out with any questions or comments.\n\n\nThanks for your continued support!\n\n\nJenny, Head of Finance\n\n",

Our New Buffer MRR/ARR segment grew by 1.51% and overall MRR/ARR grew by 0.20%.\n\n\n## Note-worthy updates and reflections\n\n\n**Create Launch**\n\n\nLast month I shared that we were preparing to launch [Buffer’s new Board](https://buffer.com/create) view to all users in April. This went live on Wednesday, April 17th. With the brand new Board view users can:\n\n- Drag and drop their content ideas into fully customizable columns\n- Visualize their progress from \"To Do\" to \"Done\"\n- Organize content by format, channel, team member or however they’d like\n\nThis new space allows users to create and organize all of their content within Buffer. Users who were previously using Trello or another task management tool are loving this feature. Whether it’s an image, a blog post, or even just a random thought users can now: save it in Buffer, tag it, repurpose it for any social channel, and automatically publish it at the best time. Based on initial launch results we’re seeing that Board view converts new signups from the Marketing Page. And when reflecting on the Create features more generally, we’re seeing that users who start in the Create part of the app have higher retention.\n\n\n**Facebook Group Reminders**\n\n\nEarlier this year Meta announced their plans to sunset API support for [Facebook Groups](https://buffer.com/library/facebook-group/) effective April 22nd. As a result, our engineers and PMs have been working to ensure our customers have a solution in place to continue connecting Facebook Groups. While automatic scheduling to Facebook Groups is no longer possible, Buffer will continue to support publishing to Facebook Groups using mobile notifications (i.e. reminders). On April 22nd, we released reminders for Facebook Groups.\n\n\nWith notification based publishing, users can still create their post in Buffer, receive a notification on their mobile device when it’s time to post, and then tap the notification and copy their post over to their Facebook group to finish publishing.\n\n\nNotification publishing tends to give users more flexibility with what they can schedule, as they aren’t bound to any API limitations. For example, users can schedule a Poll or an Event. Additionally, while users previously needed to be an admin of a Facebook Group to schedule a post to the group, with notification publishing, users can now post as a non-admin group member.\n\n\nOverall, as expected, posting volume has dropped with this change but channel connection only slightly declined, further validating that users are finding value in notification publishing.\n\n\n**Marketing**\n\n\nOur resources blog had one of its best months of traffic in April thanks to a strong focus on SEO, content refreshes, and some stellar new content that have extended our search footprint. Our design team is also making serious progress on refining the design style for our upcoming Web refresh. We’re excited for this refresh to go live in the coming months.\n\n\n**Profitability**\n\n\nWhile we are celebrating our first profitable month since January 2023, it is notable that profitability in April was primarily driven by a reduction in our OPEX spend. Our top line revenue declined by ~$6,400 from March to April. We’re looking more deeply into this alongside a general decline we’re seeing in some of our leading indicators like signups and activations. After a strong Q1, we believe that some seasonality is at play here and we are investigating different strategies to hedge against this.\n\n\nThat’s it for April. We’ll be back in touch in June to share our May results. In the meantime, please feel free to reach out with any questions or comments.\n\n\nThanks for your continued support!\n\n\nJenny, Head of Finance\n\n",

I’ll be sharing the metrics and key updates for Buffer for March 2024. I’m happy to take any questions or comments while Joel is away! \n\n\n\u003e 📊 [MetricsTable]  \n\u003e _Check out this post on_ [_buffer.com/shareholders_](https://buffer.com/shareholders) _to see the metrics table._\n\n- _This is a fun one to celebrate - in March, our MRR/ARR hit the highest level of any day in 2023!_\n- _The New Buffer segment continues to perform strongly, while our Legacy segment continues to decline and become a smaller portion of our overall MRR. As of March, New Buffer MRR now makes up for 75% of our total MRR and 72% of our total paid customers are on New Buffer plans._\n- _Overall, Q1 proved to be a strong quarter and we remain on track for a growth year overall for 2024._\n\n## Note-worthy updates and reflections\n\n\n### **Retreat**\n\n\nFor the first time since 2019, we gathered together for a Buffer retreat in Cancún, Mexico! Teammates flew in from all over the world to spend a week in-person discussing upcoming projects, aligning on culture and strategy, and bonding. It’s a rare treat for our remote team to enjoy things like meals, and meetings unencumbered by timezones. Teammates reported that the cross-functional sessions were especially valuable, particularly our company-wide inbox time, when the whole team replied to customer questions in the support inbox. During free time, Bufferoos swam in the ocean, competed in beach volleyball, played card games, and enjoyed treats that we brought from all over. (The most controversial were Candy Corn and Vegemite!) We’re enjoying the great energy from this time together and looking for ways to recreate a bit of the magic remotely.\n\n\n### **Growth \u0026 Q1 results**\n\n\nAfter 10 consecutive quarters of MRR decline, Q1 marked our first quarter of MRR growth since Q2 of 2021. New Buffer MRR now makes up 75.0% of total MRR, and New Buffer customers increased by 3,435 in Q1 to make up 72% of total paying customers. We also saw a small uptick in Average Revenue Per User (ARPU). Revenue grew by .6% in Q1 hitting $4.5M, our largest revenue total since the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\n\nOur total operating expenses were higher than average in March due to the recognition of 2024 retreat costs. Because of this, we finished March with a pretty significant loss of $262K putting our net income for the first quarter at a total loss of $410K. As of the end of March, our cash runway is 27 months (up one month from February) and our bank balance remains strong.\n\n\n### **Mobile Apps Growth**\n\n\nWe’re seeing continued growth in app-paid subscribers due to several UX growth experiments, the rollout of annual paid plans, and several key projects that the team shipped in Q1. In Q1, new paid subscribers (weekly) went up 15% from 75/week to ~90/week. As a result, two powerful insights have emerged:  1) The **queue or post limit** is a highly effective upgrade path, especially if it is shown to users **before** they reach the 10-post limit 2) A **highly visible** upgrade CTA delivers strong results in mobile apps, even if they are generic (vs. feature-specific).\n\n\n### **We moved New Board View to Beta**\n\n\nWe introduced Buffer’s New Board view and invited users to the Beta version which sets the stage for a larger product launch in April. Buffer’s new Board view will allow users to create and organize content by format or channel, keep track of different team member contributions, and visualize the progress from “to-do” to “done”. We will launch this to all users in April.\n\n\n### **Instagram Universal Publishing** **(aka Reminders)**\n\n\nIn March, we launched a new notification publishing option for Instagram. This allows users to plan any type of Instagram content in advance; whether they want to fully automate their post or handcraft each Reel and Story, Buffer now has more publishing options to suit every Instagram creator. Users will enjoy more flexibility and power with every post and can choose the option that best suits them. **Automatic publishing** allows users to set it and forget it. Buffer will automatically post on their behalf and they don’t have to lift a finger once a post is scheduled. **Notification publishing** allows users to add stickers, music and enjoy more creative control. Buffer will tee up the post, send a notification based on a user’s defined schedule, and help users finish the post on Instagram. Both options are available on all Buffer plans, including the free plan.\n\n\nThis sets the stage for a larger product theme slated for later this year. Our forthcoming launch aligns with our vision to provide our users with more flexibility by expanding publishing options across all Buffer channels, incorporating both automated and notification-based social sharing, alongside strengthening the notification features and settings.\n\n\nThat’s it for March. I’ll be in touch soon to share the next update for April and Joel will be back to share our May results in June.\n\n\nThanks for your continued support!\n\n\nJenny Terry, Head of Finance\n\n",

It goes into more depth than my monthly updates of the metrics, strategy, and changes we’ve undergone at Buffer in the past year.\n\n\nI’m happy to share Buffer’s metrics and key updates for January 2024. As always, hit reply with comments or questions.\n\n\n\u003e 📊 [MetricsTable]  \n\u003e _Check out this post on_ [_buffer.com/shareholders_](/6d72d21488984f0f9c02f967cc2967c7) _to see the metrics table._\n\n- _I’d like to take a moment to celebrate that we’re seeing positive increases across the board in our numbers._\n- _There’s so much diligence and hard work by the team that has gone into getting to this point._\n- _We’re finally growing again, and not only growing MRR/ARR but also paying customers._\n- _It’s worth noting that while we had a great turnaround year in 2023 and grew 5 of 12 months (vs 1 of 12 the prior year), we had zero months where we grew the number of paying customers._\n- _For our “down and wide” strategy of focusing on creators, entrepreneurs, and small businesses, our goal is to be growing both MRR/ARR and paying customers._\n- _This month provides a great example of what we’d like to be achieving on a regular basis._\n\n## **Note-worthy updates and reflections**\n\n\n### **LinkedIn Documents (aka PDF Carousels) and First Comment**\n\n\nIn December we rolled out support for LinkedIn Documents. These are the type of post that appears as a carousel on LinkedIn. They’re a great option to have, they do very well, and now you can fully plan and schedule them within Buffer. In January, we added support for scheduling a post to LinkedIn with a First Comment. This is another very useful capability to have in your toolkit. There’s some debate as to whether you should include links in the post itself or put it in the first comment. From my personal experience, putting the link in comments does indeed increase reach of the post. Now you can do this with Buffer. [Read more](https://e.customeriomail.com/e/c/eyJlIjoxMjk3MzAsImVtYWlsX2lkIjoiZXhhbXBsZSIsImhyZWYiOiJodHRwczovL2J1ZmZlci5jb20vbGlua2VkaW4iLCJ0IjoxNzExMDQ0OTAzfQ/42e35d1d17e3f8fb243da7342adfa69af491c36ef1f43aff86d750d0191dc1e6)\n\n\n### **Reorder Images in a Scheduled Post**\n\n\nWe also recently added support for reordering images in a post. So if you’re creating a post with multiple images, such as an Instagram carousel post, you can change the order of the images. This is a much improved experience compared to where you needed to remove and re-upload in order t get things in the right order.\n\n\n### **Paste Images and Videos into the Composer**\n\n\nAnother great UX improvement we’ve recently made is the ability to paste images and videos directly into the composer. So if you have a file on your computer, just copy it and paste it in, and it’ll get uploaded to your post. We’re moving fast with these types of UX enhancements that can add a lot of delight to the product and bring us up to and beyond the expectations of users today.\n\n\n### **100K signups**\n\n\nOne of our big wins for January was that we saw over 100K signups to Buffer. 100,200 new users signups, to be exact. Increasing top of funnel and acquisition has been a focus for the past year, and it’s wonderful to see the diligent efforts throughout 2023 come to fruition for our biggest month of signups in years. Signups for January were 39% higher than December. And while January is generally a much better month for us than December, this result was 22% higher than January 2023.\n\n\n## **What’s coming up**\n\n\n### **Company Retreat!**\n\n\nWe’re meeting up in person as a whole team very soon. We’ll be together in Cancún, Mexico for the first week of March. This will be our first whole company retreat since 2019. While we’ve had quite a number of team meetups in the past couple of years, we haven’t been together as a whole team, and we’re feeling that connection debt. Company retreats come at a significant cost, however we have found again and again that the level of alignment and deeper connection we are able to achieve in the week we are together, pays dividends for many months beyond the retreat itself.\n\n\n### **User Experience Improvements**\n\n\nWe’re charging ahead with many more UX improvements, and some of them are going to be even more foundational and significant than what we’ve put out there so far. We’re in the midst of revamping our card style for posts in the queue, and the whole interface for publishing to bring alignment between the different views (queue and calendar). We’re also working on a way to seamlessly view one, multiple, or all social channels and see scheduled posts, sent posts, drafts, etc. We’re making a big bet that adding significant flexibility to Buffer will allow us to keep expanding to more use cases, as well as make the product more intuitive to use.\n\n\n### **Meta Threads**\n\n\nWe’re on standby to add Meta’s Threads as a new channel rapidly once they announce an API. We’ve had hints that it could come any day now, and we expect it to happen in the first half of the year. We’ve been doing all the implementation we can on our side without the authentication and various endpoints, and we’ll be ready to hook everything up and launch very fast when the day comes. This is going to be a huge value add for folks as Threads is growing fast right now, and a lot of people want more help to easily post across more channels. We’re fortunate to be in a time right now of emergence of new channels, exactly what Buffer can help with.\n\n\nThat’s it for my January update. I’ll be back in touch soon with February results.\n\n\n— Joel Gascoigne, Founder CEO\n\n",

This was a decline of 1.75% from the prior year and represented a stalling of our steeper declines in the previous years. Our number of paying customers declined 4.75% to 55,975, which was an improvement from the 6.94% decline in 2022. We concluded 2023 with a net loss of $572,827, a significant improvement from our $1,094,128 net loss in 2022. We ended the year with $3,219,455 in the bank, representing 21 months of runway. We improved our operating (EBITDA) margin from -2.65% in 2022 to -1.86% in 2023. Combining our ARR growth rate and operating margin, our rule of 40 for 2023 was -3.60%, an improvement from -10.22% in 2022.\n\n\nDelving into our results by quarter, it becomes more clear that we have stalled the decline. The majority of our decline for 2023 occurred in Q1, where we saw a 1.22% decline in MRR/ARR. From there, we had two relatively flat quarters in Q2 (-0.03%) and Q3 (-0.07%), and concluded the year with a slightly steeper dip (-0.42%), which mostly occurred in December (typically our slowest month). On a monthly basis, we had 7 months of decline in 2023 and 5 months where we grew, in contrast to 2022, where we declined for 11 of 12 months.\n\n\nIt’s valuable to focus on leading indicators, as by definition, they will indicate that improvements are coming in other metrics. 2023 was a successful year for Buffer across our most important leading indicators. We saw a 2.21% increase in Monthly Active Users to 139,377. Our most significant success was in growing our number of signups, where we welcomed 946,614 new user signups to Buffer, a 28.95% increase compared to 2022. We also saw an increase in new paying customers, with 39,463 new paying customers in 2023, a 9.97% increase from the prior year. This number is likely slightly inflated as we saw a spike in spam / fraudulent new paying customers in April 2023, however, normalizing for this still puts our increase at around 7.5%.\n\n\n### Legacy to New Buffer transition\n\n\nBuffer is at a pivotal moment in time in the transition of our pricing and packaging model. In mid-2021, we rolled out new pricing on a per-channel model, in contrast to our previous pricing model, where we bundled the number of channels (social accounts) in each paid plan. This change in pricing enabled customers to grow either the number of channels or the number of team members independent of each other for the first time. We implemented this through a separate paid team plan, also priced per channel, where customers can work with as many collaborators as they want. Along with the new pricing model, we packaged our entire toolkit into a single price rather than charging separately for Publishing, Analytics, and Engagement tools. This brings a new level of simplicity to Buffer’s product offering, with a single price for all of our functionality, which can scale based on additional channels, features, or team members.\n\n\nThese changes were fairly significant compared to our legacy pricing, and given our long-term and customer-centric approach to business, we made a deliberate choice not to force a migration for our longstanding customers. This started a multi-year process of a shift towards our new pricing and packaging, which we have internally called New Buffer. It’s worth breaking down the results of New Buffer compared to Legacy Buffer segments, as they tell their own story of the 2023 results. Since mid-2021, all new users have gone onto the New Buffer experience, and we have added the majority of new functionality only to New Buffer. In late 2022, we introduced a self-serve migration experience for customers to move over from Legacy to New Buffer if they wish. The model is so different that, in some cases, it could result in a price decrease, and for others, could result in a price increase. This is one of the many reasons we have chosen not to force customers to migrate.\n\n\nIn 2023, our New Buffer segment grew 60.63% to $12,491,457 ARR and grew to 36,943 paying customers (a 44.17% increase). In contrast, the Legacy Buffer segment declined 47.98% to $5,456,432 ARR and dropped to 19,004 paying customers (-42.66%). Notably, MRR/ARR on New Buffer plans grew from 42.46% to 69.58% in 2023. As we started the year with Legacy as the majority, we saw the impact overall in our numbers. However, as the year went on, we saw the New Buffer segment become the majority of MRR and paying customers and continue to show strong growth. This is what gives us confidence in a great 2024.\n\n\n## Our Down and Wide Strategy\n\n\n### Serving entrepreneurs and small businesses\n\n\nBuffer was founded on a love for serving entrepreneurs and small businesses. I counted myself in that category when I started the company, and we got our initial growth through a freemium model and great content marketing. With a very low barrier to trying the product, an approach of giving away a lot of value, and leading with our value of transparency, we’ve built a strong brand.\n\n\nIn the last few years, we have doubled down on that passion for creators, entrepreneurs, and small businesses. A large part of what drove our incredible 2023 results in new user signups was that at the end of 2022, we made our primary flow for new users go straight into the free plan. We believe that Buffer can be the best product in our space for these folks, who typically have low budgets and have very little time as they’re wearing multiple hats. It can often be seen as an unattractive segment due to these reasons, but for us, this segment is about dreams and possibility, and we love being the product that helps folks go from zero to one and beyond.\n\n\nWe have a team who love to serve small businesses. Many people join Buffer because they want to be at a truly product-led, customer-focused company. It's a totally different game, our volume is significant, and we have different tools we can work with.\n\n\n### Lessons from consumer SaaS\n\n\nTo serve the down market segment of creators, entrepreneurs, and small businesses successfully, we’ve leaned into seeking lessons from consumer SaaS rather than purely the widespread enterprise SaaS playbooks.\n\n\nIn enterprise SaaS, reducing churn is a top priority, and significantly growing average revenue per user (ARPU) is a focus. If we take that approach, we will not serve our customers well, and we will also lose our bigger opportunity to be a more widespread and ubiquitous tool in the market. Our monthly customer churn rate hovered a little above 5% for most of 2023, which would be considered too high for many SaaS businesses. Yet, when serving small businesses, you need to live with an inherently high churn rate. As Ben Chestnut, the Founder CEO of Mailchimp, famously said, “when you serve small business, the churn rate is awful.”\n\n\nThe way we will win when it comes to growth is combining lessons from consumer SaaS with the opportunities we have for standard SaaS growth strategies. A useful metric I came across in the last couple of years is carrying capacity, which is calculated as the number of new paying customers per month divided by the customer churn rate per month. This number gives you the number of paying customers, at which point you will cease to grow because the customers you gain will be equal to the customers you lose. This isn’t a perfect metric for us, as we do indeed get some growth from expansion and increase in ARPU, however, it highlights the impact of growing the number of paying customers versus decreasing churn rate.\n\n\nI have asserted many times to the team in the past couple of years that there will always be a ceiling to how much we can reduce churn, however, there is no ceiling to how many new users and customers we can find who will gain value from Buffer. This has led us to put focus on new user signups, activation, and retention, and we are starting to see that we can see growth while focusing on this segment.\n\n\n### Down and wide strategy for growth and thriving\n\n\nThe simplest way to describe our current overall strategy is “down and wide.” By “down,” I mean that we are expanding down-market to serve individuals (creators, entrepreneurs, influencers, professionals) as well as small businesses. The goal of going “wide” is to increase the breadth of our product and serve customers with a wider range of solutions to problems.\n\n\nWe’ve gone further down-market in the past year by streamlining our signup and onboarding flow, adding almost all new value to the free plan in addition to paid plans (sometimes with limits), and by adding more automation and flexibility, for example, through our [improved Zapier integration](https://buffer.com/resources/buffer-zapier-integration/). One way we’ve been going wide is by offering more publishing channels; where we added two more ([TikTok](https://buffer.com/resources/tiktok-scheduling/) and [Google Business Profiles](https://buffer.com/resources/introducing-google-business-profiles/)) in 2022 and another two ([Mastodon](https://buffer.com/resources/mastodon-scheduling/) and [YouTube Shorts](https://buffer.com/resources/youtube-shorts-scheduling/)) last year. Another is by offering tools beyond social media, such as [Start Page](https://buffer.com/start-page), our simple microsite, or link-in-bio builder.\n\n\nWe believe the down-and-wide strategy is uniquely ours to take on because our passion for entrepreneurs and small businesses is embedded in the DNA and culture of the company, and we are in a unique position of being at scale without traditional investor pressure to go up-market. At the same time, the fact we are established means that we can build out a comprehensive offering and we have existing partnerships with the social networks, and a strong brand people are able to trust is here to stay and continue serving them.\n\n\n### How we want to grow Buffer\n\n\nGiven the clarity of our strategy and our cultural DNA, I have spent some time reflecting on the 13 years Buffer has existed and the ways we have either grown or declined each year.\n\n\nWith SaaS, there are a limited number of ways you can grow. One of the simplest equations for MRR is to multiply the number of paying customers by how much they pay per month (ARPU). Therefore, to grow MRR, you either need to grow the number of paying customers you have or grow your average revenue per user.\n\n\nFor most of our journey, we grew each year by growing our number of paying customers, alongside seeing steady growth in ARPU. In general, our paying customer growth outpaced our ARPU growth and was the key driver of our overall ARR growth.\n\n\nIn 2018 and 2019, we saw great ARR growth, but our paying customer growth slowed down significantly in 2018 and declined in 2019. We achieved this by building functionality exclusively for paid plans and further restricting the free plan. I later reflected and realized that to continue this type of growth, we would find ourselves going fully up-market. For many SaaS companies, a strategy of growing ARPU while seeing the number of paying customers remain stable or even decline may be sensible. For Buffer, growing ARPU aggressively goes against our mission to serve and help more entrepreneurs and small businesses thrive. Additionally, extrapolating it over multiple years would represent a drastic change in our business model and culture. Beyond seeing the challenges ahead in growing this way, I personally felt a real conflict in my own sense of purpose when we dabbled with going up-market. This is one factor which led to my decision to double down on individuals, the free plan, and our down-and-wide strategy.\n\n\nGoing forward, our goal is to grow Buffer primarily by growing the number of customers we serve. We expect ARPU to grow steadily as we add value to our offering. Indeed, ARPU grew 3.2% in 2023 without any changes to pricing or any reductions in our free offering. We achieved this by introducing new channels and adding more value to our paid plans. We’d love to have customers grow with us over time while maintaining a very low barrier to starting to use Buffer.\n\n\nTaking this to a leading indicator and earlier step in the user flow, we have put a clear focus on significantly growing new user signups. In 2023, we saw a 28.95% increase in signups with 946,614 people signing up to try Buffer. We achieved this through a renewed focus on growth marketing, SEO, and content marketing alongside our product improvements and launches.\n\n\n### How we approach freemium\n\n\nThere’s a lot of conflicting advice out there on how to approach freemium and whether to have a free plan or just offer a free trial.\n\n\nFor us, our choice to offer a free plan is more philosophical than purely tactical. Where others may experiment and go with whatever they find gives them the most growth, we are making a fundamental commitment to serve those early in their journey. There’s no better way to serve creators and entrepreneurs starting out than to have a great free plan.\n\n\nHaving a free plan is also a long-term decision. One way to think about a free plan is an unlimited time trial. Of course, restricting the timeframe of the trial will lead to more new paying customers in the short term. Over time, however, you’ve lost those people who could gradually build a habit using the product, see value from a free offering, and grow their project or business to the point where they are in a position to pay for a tool. We want to be there for customers at every step of the way, and we’re making a bet that by taking care of them early on for free, they’ll choose us when they’re at the next level in their journey. We’re privileged in being able to take a long-term approach here, and we’re confident that the results will compound over time.\n\n\nDuring 2023, we started a process of auditing and improving our approach to freemium across all of our tools. Our goal is to have a freemium model across all aspects of the Buffer product, where some portion of most value is available on the free plan. Unless the functionality is truly more advanced in nature, we’d like to include it on the free plan. We’ve found over many years that letting people actually use something (with a usage limit) is a more effective way to show people the value of upgrading than paywalling functionality entirely. This isn’t reflected across all our product yet, but over time, we’ll gradually make changes so that Buffer holistically reflects this strategy.\n\n\nOne other learning I’ve had with freemium is that if you stop investing in the free plan, it will become less effective. It sounds obvious, but it’s so easy to fall into the trap of starting with a strong free plan and then, after a few years, only improving paid plans. We’ve seen a lot of changes in social media over the years, and the world has become a lot more comfortable with a variety of media types and functionality (just think about Instagram with stories, reels, stickers, trending audio, etc.). As users become more comfortable with a wider range of functionality and variety of social networks, our free offering needs to reflect what is available at this baseline natively on the networks.\n\n\n### Renewed customer and community focus\n\n\nOne of our key efforts in going down-market and significantly increasing the number of people actively using Buffer, has been to become even more customer-centric and engaged with our community.\n\n\nIn 2023, we rolled out two key initiatives to drive us to not only be listening to our customers, but held accountable by our customers. This shift has helped make it easier for us to ensure we’re genuinely building functionality and making improvements that our customers need.\n\n\nWe launched a new feedback forum called [Buffer Suggestions](https://suggestions.buffer.com/) for customers to request features and improvements and vote and comment on existing ideas. This is a public and transparent forum where if we do not actively manage it and engage with customers, it will reflect poorly on the brand. This was a significant step towards a strategy of embedding customers much more into how we work and build as a company. We’ve already found this to be a goldmine of insights for us in building the product.\n\n\nAdditionally, we also launched an [Open Beta program](https://buffer.com/resources/build-week-2023/). In the past we’ve included customers in the rollout of new functionality, however this was done through a closed beta approach where we would reach out specifically to a subset of customers and invite them to try new features. With Open Beta, we’ve made it possible for any user to opt in to access and receive new functionality on beta in advance of it launching to the wider customer base. We have a new page available in every Buffer Account where users can view all the current functionality in beta, enable or disable beta at any time, and a button to share feedback (this links to the Buffer Suggestions page for that feature).\n\n\nWe have continued to invest in [our community space](https://buffer.com/community), which exists primarily in Discord, alongside actively engaging with our community across all of our social channels. We had a thriving community in our earlier days, but neglected it and let it wither during years where we had a strategy more focused on businesses. With our renewed focus on the down-market segment, our community is once again a vital component of the equation of Buffer thriving. It has taken some concerted and diligent effort to rebuild our community, and it is now on track and feeling like a win-win for community members and Buffer.\n\n\nFinally, we started an effort in the later part of the year to make a step change improvement to our already great customer support. We finished the year with a median first response time during business hours of 2.15 hours, a 41% improvement year over year. Our current baseline goal is to have the majority of customers receive a response to any customer support request within 2 hours and for 99% of requests to be answered within 24 hours. In an industry known for awful customer service, we believe this can be an additional competitive advantage.\n\n\n### Investing in modernizing Buffer\n\n\nFor a 13-year-old product and company, tech and organizational / process debt is a given. In the past year, we’ve recognized this is a significant threat to our long-term success and have introduced a few key projects to pay down this debt. We are especially at risk in having inferior UX to newer competitors in the space, as they have the benefit of building from scratch with modern tooling. We’re energized to improve in this areas as it makes using the product ourselves much more enjoyable, and improves the developer experience for engineers too.\n\n\nOn the product side, we started an initiative we’ve called Consumer Grade User Experience (CGX), with the goal to level up the UX and clarity of the product significantly. This is taking the form of establishing a complete design system, upgraded components and a visual refresh. We’ve taken an iterative approach and the new design system and components are already going live across our newer functionality launched later in the year. This work is already making Buffer feel snappier and more fun to use, and it also paves the way for some welcome side benefits such as theming or dark mode.\n\n\nWe’ve also made an effort to move faster with some features that are expected in modern software, and in September rolled out our cmd/control K “Quick Navigator” functionality. This came out of [our annual build week](https://buffer.com/resources/build-week-at-buffer/), where we spend a week working in small teams across the whole company on ideas contributed by anyone in the company.\n\n\nWe’ve also made a variety of process and organizational improvements to pay down the debt that can build up over many years of operating. One of the most significant efforts in this area was to reimagine our salary formula and eliminate discrepancies and inconsistencies which built up over a number of years. The results of this was our new [Open Salary System](https://buffer.com/resources/salary-system/).\n\n\n## A Long-Term Company and Product\n\n\n### Buffer’s Operating Principles\n\n\nIn the second half of 2023, I established Buffer’s Operating Principles. These are principles I had been reflecting on for many years, and the time felt right to introduce these principles to the team. The four operating principles are intended to give us high-level guidance and clarity on how we operate the business. Whereas our Values describe how we work individually, the Operating Principles guide how we run the company. Our operating principles are:\n\n\nLong-Term: We have a goal for the company to exist and thrive for decades. We prioritize patient compounding company and personal growth over shortcuts. We think and plan ahead based on the shifts we’re seeing in the industry and the world.\n\n\nIndependent: The company is primarily owned and controlled by those working week in, week out on it. We go our own path with our product and culture. Owning our destiny and being founder-led enables genuine mission-driven focus.\n\n\nAmbitious: We have a lofty goal and belief that more small businesses is better for the world. We must be growing in order to serve more customers and fulfill our vision.\n\n\nEfficient: We’re a tight-knit, small-for-revenues team. We have a goal to run the company with a healthy profit margin. Every person on the team matters, we must be deliberate in our decisions, and everyone must be continually growing.\n\n\nThese operating principles felt natural to us all when I shared them in our October All Hands, and at the same time, the additional clarity has driven great proactiveness across all teams in pursuing and meeting the principles to a higher bar.\n\n\n### Our opportunity\n\n\nWe’ve now weathered several years of declines, all while clarifying our strategy and the customers we are serving and increasing our diligence and efficiency as a company. Looking ahead, I see healthy growth for us in 2024, but even more importantly, we are now set up to pursue a more significant opportunity.\n\n\nBuffer has existed for 13 years now, we have over 55,000 paying customers, and we see over 80,000 new users sign up per month. We have the strength of our long-term journey so far, and we have the independence to grow Buffer into something special without short-term investor pressure. In 2023, we made a significant investment into modernizing the product and paying down our tech and org debt, to ensure that we can remain a flexible and fast-moving product and company.\n\n\nWith this foundation, we have the opportunity to be the most widespread product and work towards being the ubiquitous organic social media marketing (and eventually, organic marketing overall) platform for creators, entrepreneurs, and small businesses. As we work towards this larger opportunity, we will have the privilege to serve hundreds of thousands of people and help them to get their dreams off the ground. As we see this vision come to fruition, we believe that entirely new opportunities for product expansion and growth will arise.\n\n\n### Flexibility in the product\n\n\nTo succeed in our down-market shift and our goals to be a much more widespread product, we need to achieve both breadth and comprehensiveness of functionality (to cater to a wide range of use cases), and simplicity (to ensure the product is intuitive and easy to use for individuals). One of our key approaches to achieving this is by creating a much more flexible product.\n\n\nIn 2023, we made a significant upgrade to our existing Campaigns functionality, in the process transforming it into [Tags](https://buffer.com/resources/introducing-tags-organize-content/). Whereas Campaigns was very prescriptive as to the use case, Tags are much more flexible. You can use tags for campaigns, but you can also use them for much more, such as for the type of post, for goals, or verticals. We launched Tags for all plans, with a limit of 3 tags on the free plan, adhering to our strategy of freemium across almost all of our functionality.\n\n\nAI is also a way for us to add flexibility and save customers time. We see AI as one of our biggest opportunities, and also something that could be a threat. If we execute well, we can stay ahead of the ways that AI can transform the social media management space and continue to be a thriving and successful offering. This is why we launched [our AI Assistant](https://buffer.com/resources/introducing-buffers-ai-assistant/) early in 2023, and made two further iterations to improve it along the way. We have still only scratched the surface with how much we can incorporate AI into the product to streamline usage of Buffer.\n\n\nOne of the investments we’re making in 2024 is to rethink how we approach supporting new and a wider range of channels. We have 13 years of experience adapting to a variety of levels of API access for publishing, analytics and engagement with social networks. We’re planning an upgrade which will enable us to help customers no matter the API limitations, through functionality that gracefully adapts to the access available. This will also allow us to accelerate the number of channels we support, which we have validated correlates with growth.\n\n\n### The social media landscape\n\n\nThere have been some fascinating shifts across social networks and the social media management space in 2023.\n\n\nWhere vertical video dominated in the prior few years, 2023 saw the return of text-based social networks with the rise of Mastodon, the launch of Meta’s Threads, and other contenders such as Bluesky. Much of this was driven by the changes made at X (Twitter), and it is a welcome change in terms of the variety of options for consumers. We’ve seen an increase in the opportunities to serve customers, given the increased complexity that these changes bring about.\n\n\nAnother important shift taking place is the advent of decentralized social networks, including the Fediverse. We believe the efforts being made towards open standards for social networking are important for the Internet and the world, and we were one of the fastest to move to support Mastodon in early 2023.\n\n\nAcross our space, we’ve observed a number of the more established players move up-market, which has opened up even more space as we’ve made conscious efforts to expand down-market.  We now see an opportunity to be the largest product in our space by volume of active users and paying customers. Early in 2023, X (Twitter) increased the cost of their API significantly, and this led to a wide number of the smaller products being unable to continue to offer X (Twitter). Social media management continues to be a crowded market overall, and so we’ve made increased efforts to be clear in our strategy and establish a position that is uniquely ours to take and hard for others to replicate.\n\n\n### Buffer’s ownership now and in the future\n\n\nAs of the end of 2023, Buffer’s ownership breakdown is as follows:\n\n- Founder CEO: 57.12% of issued, 44.49% fully diluted\n- Investors: 38.06% of issued, 29.64% fully diluted\n- Teammates: 1.16% of issued, 6.75% fully diluted\n- Alumni: 3.66% of issued, 5.86% fully diluted\n- Vendors: 0.2% fully diluted\n\nOur ownership breakdown by share class:\n\n- Common: 91.4% of issued, 71.2% fully diluted\n- Series AA (seed): 5.6% of issued, 4.4% fully diluted\n- Series A: 3.0% of issued, 2.3% fully diluted\n- Stock options: 8.9% fully diluted\n- Remaining option pool: 13.0% fully diluted\n- Warrants: 0.2% fully diluted\n\nWe have raised just $4M in total over our 13-year journey, and our last round of funding was in 2014. Since 2017, we have repurchased 21.2% of fully diluted shares, increasing the value of existing shareholders. This has also enabled us to shift the shareholder base to a group aligned with our long-term approach.\n\n\nGiven our strong bank balance going into a period of decline, with some investors seeking liquidity, we have taken a number of opportunities to repurchase stock in the past few years. As we started to see the signs of a turnaround year and our journey back towards growth with a healthy bank balance, we took the opportunity to carry out three stock repurchases in 2023, at a collective cost of $889K.\n\n\nFor most technology companies, the path to liquidity is through an exit, i.e. being acquired or going public. As a company with plans to continue to exist independently for the long-term, our approach to liquidity needs to be different than the norm.\n\n\nThe topic of achieving liquidity in alignment with our independence and long-term goals is one I’ve given considerable thought to over the years. At times, I even considered whether it makes most sense to do away with stock options, and instead focus more on profit sharing.\n\n\nHowever, I’d like to give team members the opportunity for real ownership in Buffer, and for those who stay at Buffer and grow in seniority to become meaningful genuine owners of the company. To accomplish this, we need a way to issue options for new team members, and additional options for tenure and growth in impact.\n\n\nAn ownership mindset is a core part of our culture and strategy. Having a team who feel a genuine sense of ownership is integral to making the equation of Buffer as a company work. We provide a lot of flexibility and aim to have a working environment that enables people to thrive and contribute long-term without burning out. This doesn’t work if team members don’t feel a connection to and a sense of ownership of Buffer. The ownership mindset is one element that motivates people to go above and beyond in order to make Buffer successful.\n\n\nThere are few ways more powerful in creating an ownership mindset in the team, than giving people true ownership in the company. Combining this with documentation and education that helps in understanding that ownership stake they hold, is where it becomes especially effective. For this reason, in 2024 we will be rolling out a new approach to equity and stock options with a new formula with initial grants as well as evergreen (tenure) and promotion grants. I plan to use sizable portion of the remaining option pool to get this off the ground, accounting for future team growth too.\n\n\nTo make Buffer sustainable long-term with stock options and genuine ownership, as well as liquidity, without a plan to exit; I have started to reflect on opportunities for regular liquidity events where we invite long-term minded investors to purchase stock from team members, alumni and investors who have held Buffer stock over the long-term. In this way, I believe we can achieve a long-term, independent company with great returns over time for everyone involved.\n\n\n## The Buffer Team in Build Mode\n\n\n### Making corrections from our previous era\n\n\nOver the years, Buffer become fairly slow-moving. This was true both in terms of what we built and also how we worked internally. The simplest reason I can point to for that decline in pace is that we became debilitated by debt. At around 10 years old as a company, we had accrued significant tech, process, and cultural debt. Our market had become very crowded, and we had not adapted effectively to maintain our market leadership position. We lost the clear differentiation we had, both in terms of our market position with the product and additionally, our culture, to a certain extent, had become diluted and less bold and unique.\n\n\nWe had been resting on our laurels and continued building layer upon layer on top of what initially got us our growth and success, without real breakthroughs, changes, or reflecting from first principles. Our attempts to find new growth were inconsistent and lacked grounding in a clear overall mission and conviction. The very high quality we once had of both our product and service gradually degraded. All of these issues were reflected in our numbers, which plateaued and then started to decline. The numbers started to feel out of our control, but were the result of our many cumulative actions. We had made changes to the product and our pricing and packaging that moved us away from the very people we initially served. I felt my own passion for what we were doing start to wane, and I knew that I needed to do some deeper reflection in order to feel motivated once again.\n\n\nPersonally, I was becoming less and less proud of what Buffer had become, and the ways I had allowed it to slip there. As the CEO, I was too hands-off and was too many steps removed from the work and customers. So, at the beginning of 2022, I started to make an increasing number of changes to get us back on track to the nimble, bold, unique brand we’ve become known as.\n\n\n### A focus on efficiency as a team\n\n\nA key change we made was to get back into “build mode” as a company. We had slipped into maintenance mode, which is easy to do when growth is consistent and feels like it can be expected. As we started to plateau and decline, it started to feel even more alarming, as we were effectively managing and maintaining our decline rather than taking necessary action to turn it around. This has served as a reminder that no matter the season, we can only keep growing and innovating if we keep building. Embracing “build mode” led to a variety of changes across the organization to shift us back towards being a group of builders.\n\n\nDuring 2023, we simplified our communication by significantly reducing the number of slack channels and establishing a clear and intuitive naming convention for all future channels. We also streamlined our organizational structure by reducing layers and choosing not to backfill and replace every manager who moved on. We made the tough decision to say goodbye to a few folks in cases where we had more managers than necessary, or where we were skewed too junior. Through these changes, we have been able to reduce the manager:individual contributor ratio.\n\n\nWe increased the expectations of all leaders and managers being in the details, having on-the-ground context and truly owning the results of that team or function rather than primarily being concerned about managing people.\n\n\nFinally, we’ve set our sights on getting back to profitability and believe we can achieve this in late 2024 or early 2025. There are a variety of reasons that profitability is so important to us at Buffer. We're not on a path of raising continual rounds of funding, and we have not raised a round of funding in nine years. We are essentially customer-funded, and therefore we must be profitable for that to work long-term. Beyond that, profitability allows us to breathe and put some resources into bigger bets and innovations that could lead to more step-change outcomes.\n\n\n### Raising our bar of ambition\n\n\nThroughout 2023, we systematically raised the bar for what we put out there and accordingly raised expectations across the team. The mission and strategy we have is lofty, and we've clarified with our operating principles that being ambitious is a key part of Buffer. Personally for me, I see hitting a higher bar overall as genuinely feeling proud of everything we ship, the service we provide, and the way that we work.\n\n\nTo hit our more ambitious goals, we need managers and leaders who are highly proficient in their craft. This means that those leaders can provide guidance for the team at a much more detailed and tangible level. This point also relates to the earlier one on leaders owning their team's results.\n\n\nWe’ve also firmly established an expectation of continual growth in every role and that individuals are the primary ones leading their own growth. Self-led growth is aligned with our longstanding value to Improve Consistently. If we stand still, the world will change around us, and we will fail. We, therefore, need everyone in the team to be continually leveling up and growing. This is not something we've been clear on in the past, and so we took some time to share this shift with the team.\n\n\nWe’ve introduced the expectation of an ownership mindset, rather than an entitlement mindset, to our flexible work practices such as remote work and the 4-day workweek. These practices are designed to enable all of us to do the best work of our careers and to sustain that high level for many years. It's imperative that we take an ownership mindset to this type of flexibility that we've offered for years at Buffer. Put simply, we have to keep earning these benefits. These benefits are not something that individuals should feel entitled to, but rather something that we work hard as a group to achieve outcomes that allow us to keep maintaining this type of incredible working experience. It is important that we all give flexibility in order to get flexibility back. This means making ourselves available at odd hours from time to time to jump on an early morning meeting or late night meeting in order to have the connection and level of collaboration with our team to achieve all of our ambitious goals.\n\n\n### Dogfooding as an expectation\n\n\nDogfooding is the term used to describe using your own product. With our down-market focus, we are building for individuals as much as we are for businesses. As we work on building a product that can deliver significant value for individuals such as creators, entrepreneurs and professionals looking to grow their audience, we will be better served if everyone at Buffer has that focus themselves in some form.\n\n\nIn 2023, we reinstated the expectation that as a Buffer team member, you are an active user of the product. In the past year, we’ve hired with this in mind and have brought some talented team members who are passionate about the potential of social media for growth and learning. Some of them are very impressive creators in their own right.\n\n\n### Being a strong team of around 80\n\n\nI've challenged myself to think about the team size from first principles. In other words, reflecting on: what it really takes to support Buffer as a product, with the breadth of the product and the number of customers we have, the choice to service them with fast and accurate responses, as well as our desire to grow further from where we are, and the requirement to maintain, expand, innovate what we already have. I’ve come to the clear conclusion that 75-85 people is the appropriate size for Buffer currently.\n\n\nFurthermore, as we have worked towards seeing consistent growth, lowering our burn rate and achieving profitability, we do not want to grow the team (i.e. employee / salary expenses) at the same pace as our revenue is growing. We want our revenue to start outpacing the team growth. We will likely want to grow over time in order to support more revenue, MAU, customers, just not exactly in proportion. This is what will enable us to grow our profit margin over time, which we'd like to do until we reach a really healthy profit margin, say 10%.\n\n\nWhile I believe around 80 is the right size for us, this is a small number for the revenue we have and the number of active users and paying customers we have. Our revenue (ARR) per employee at the end of 2023 was $233K, a high number compared to most tech companies. It's a testament to how much we achieve with the small team we are. Our above-market salaries reflect that we compensate in line with achieving a high level of performance. Every person really matters, great output from everyone in the team is vital if we're going to pull this all off. Therefore, we will make tough calls if needed where we don't see the level of performance we need to make the whole equation work.\n\n\n### Independence and tenure as an advantage\n\n\nWe’ve long been focused on remaining independent as a company. This has brought a variety of advantages, one of which is simply the fact that we’re still existing and thriving in a space that has had many products come and go. Not only that, we have remained true to our customer segment where in general the longer term competitors have gone up-market and left them behind. With that said, we haven’t leaned as much into our uniqueness and independence as a competitive advantage as we can. We have some opportunities to ensure that our independence truly acts as a benefit for us in the way we operate.\n\n\nThroughout 2023 we did a much better job of being bolder about our independence and market position. Our [Keeping Buffer Free campaign](https://twitter.com/buffer/status/1641501709233971201) early in the year was highly successful, and was one of our more punchy messages we’ve shared. And [my celebration and reflections in November on 13 years since starting the company](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joelgascoigne_13-years-ago-today-i-launched-buffer-it-activity-7136168417723629568-e0Zv?utm_source=share\u0026utm_medium=member_desktop) were very well received.\n\n\nOur independence also enables us to move faster at scale than our competitors. We don't have a complicated board approval process to make changes, and we are able to take actions that those controlled by investors simply cannot. In 2023, we leaned into reducing overhead and bringing focus to what really matters, for example, in our planning processes. We've dug in and acted more quickly when it's been clear that something isn't working or something could improve. And we've taken more opportunities to rethink and rebuild things from the ground up such as what we did with the new [Salary System](https://buffer.com/resources/salary-system/).\n\n\nWe’re fortunate to have a team who feel a sense of purpose in what we’re building, and who choose to stay and grow with Buffer over the long-term. We are very selective about who we bring on board, and in many cases, we find folks who are choosing to apply to Buffer and nowhere else. The strength of mission and cultural alignment is represented in the tenure of our team as of the end of 2023:\n\n- Average tenure: 5 years 2 months\n- On the team more than 5 years: 49.4% (39 teammates of 79)\n- On the team more than 7 years: 40.5% (32 teammates of 79)\n- On the team more than 10 years: 6.3% (5 teammates of 79)\n\nWe’re privileged to have the benefit of a long-tenured team who not only have the historical context and ingrained DNA of Buffer over the course of many years but who have grown personally as we have leveled up as a company. We will continue to invest in the culture and our uniqueness to ensure we attract folks who are finding their new long-term home rather than a stepping stone.\n\n\n### Meeting as a company in 2024\n\n\nWe couldn’t be more excited to meet in person in Cancún, Mexico as a whole company in early 2024. It’s hard to believe that our last company retreat was in 2019. We had one planned in early 2020, but of course, had to cancel it due to the pandemic. Once the world was in a place where travel made sense again, we prioritized smaller team meetups over a whole company retreat. With that said, we are definitely feeling some connection debt as a team, and we will benefit immensely from being together as a group.\n\n\nI’ve always found that retreat is the one time where we are able to truly comprehend what the whole team looks like as a collective group of humans. There’s nothing quite like working remotely and then walking into a room and seeing the whole team in one place. There’s an immediate sense of gratitude that comes from seeing everyone together in one place, and realizing the variety of roles and skillsets it takes to make Buffer a success. The level of diligence we place on the alignment of company and personal values also means that something pretty special happens at retreat; you can talk to anyone and have a wonderful, meaningful conversation. Retreat really highlights that you’ve found your people.\n\n\nWe’ve been a remote company since our earliest days, however we’ve always valued in person time as a vital part of what makes the business work. Company retreats come at a significant cost (around $400-500k), however we have found again and again that the level of alignment and deeper connection we are able to achieve in the week we are together, pays dividends for many months beyond the retreat itself. When you’ve met someone in person and had the opportunity for casual and serendipitous conversations across the spectrum of work and life topics, as well as get to know their mannerisms and quirks, you have a higher level of trust and collaboration improves.\n\n\n## In Closing\n\n\n2023 has truly been a turnaround year for Buffer. I’m so grateful to the team for the passion, diligence and care put into creating the results, and setting us up for a great 2024. I am feeling more confident than ever that with the clarity of our strategy, and the scale of the opportunity, we will be able to grow considerably over time.\n\n\nOur plan is to keep doing what we’ve been doing for over 13 years now; to exist and thrive long-term and to continue supporting entrepreneurs, creators and small businesses in getting off the ground and growing. As we do this, we will continue to share our successes and failures in an attempt to show what building a real business steadily over the long term looks like.\n\n\n_Thank you for supporting us in taking a path less traveled,_\n\n\nJoel Gascoigne, Founder CEO\n\n",

See below for our numbers, updates, and what’s coming up. As always, hit reply with comments or questions.\n\n\n\u003e 📊 [MetricsTable]  \n\u003e _Check out this post on_ [_buffer.com/shareholders_](/6d72d21488984f0f9c02f967cc2967c7) _to see the metrics table._\n\n- _It doesn’t get much flatter than 0.00% change in MRR/ARR! We were literally $73 in MRR away from shifting into positive growth territory for October._\n- _We’re seeing the flat phase I’ve talked about in recent updates continue. We’re happy to be here, and the longer we are flat the closer we are getting towards growth, since we’re still seeing the New Buffer segment grow at healthy levels. For more context on the New Buffer segment, see an update below._\n- _The sharper bank balance decline was as a result of us taking the opportunity to repurchase shares from one of our seed investors. The cost was around $400k, and is an investment we’ve felt has been worthwhile a number of times in the past few years. As a shareholder, you have benefited from these buybacks as we’ve reduced our fully diluted shares by 20% since 2017, increasing the value of your shareholding._\n- _The resulting runway number is quite a reduction from previous months, however it is worth noting that the calculation to arrive at 32 months includes this buyback, which is more of a one-off cost we took on. If we were to exclude buybacks from the runway calculation, our current runway is 74 months (6 years, 2 months). So we feel very comfortable in our current cash position._\n\n## **Note-worthy updates and reflections**\n\n\n### **AI Assistant becomes Social Media Smart**\n\n\nWe launched a significant upgrade to our AI capabilities during October. Buffer’s AI Assistant is now truly tailored to the network you’re sharing to, and we also took the time to really dig into the user experience and ensure that it’s seamless and delightful to utilize AI directly inside Buffer. [Read more](https://buffer.com/resources/introducing-ai-made-for-social-media-buffers-ai-assistant/)\n\n\n### **Tags and upgraded organization features**\n\n\nWe also launched our brand new Tags feature, which had been months in the making. You can now tag content (ideas, drafts or scheduled posts) with multiple tags. You can filter various views by tags, and this sets the foundation for even more organizational capabilities down the line. We had especially heard from users who use the Create space (ideas) extensively that it started to get unmanageable without tags or other ways to organize and filter out content. [Read more](https://buffer.com/organize)\n\n\n### **New Buffer crossed $1M MRR**\n\n\nOur New Buffer segment represents those on the new pricing we rolled out in mid-2021. This segment now represents 67% of MRR, and has been growing consistently at around 3% per month, or around $20K in net MRR growth. Around 20% of that growth has been from customers migrating over from legacy plans, the rest is pure growth. Therefore, once we see legacy fully churn out, or drive more migrations there, we should see growth months. Notably, in October our New Buffer segment crossed $1M in MRR, a milestone we’ve celebrated internally.\n\n\n### **Exec Team meetup**\n\n\nIn October, the executive team gathered in Boulder to dig into deeper topics and discuss our plans for the coming couple of quarters and focuses for 2024. Much of the meetup centered around ongoing cultural shifts and reflecting more diligently on the structure of the company and what’s needed for this next chapter as we turn the corner back towards growth. We’re ensuring that we’re set up for success in our efforts to go “down and wide” and serve the lower end of the market effectively (really succeeding with our freemium model) and getting closer to customers again both in terms of how we build the product and the quality of customer service we provide. We also discussed our operating principles (see below) to ensure our current efforts are reflective of the 4 principles. We specifically want to do more over the next year to live up to our Ambitious and Efficient operating principles.\n\n\n### **Operating Principles**\n\n\nIn our monthly company-wide All Hands meeting for October, I shared Operating Principles which I’ve been working towards for a while now. The principles add an extra layer of clarity and guidance for us alongside vision/mission and values. I see vision/mission as what and why, and both values and operating principles as describing “how” we work together. Values are on the individual level, how we each strive to work and what we can expect from one another; operating principles are at the org level, how we run the company. Our operating principles are: Long-Term, Independent, Ambitious and Efficient. [Guiding statements slide from our All Hands.](https://share.cleanshot.com/VKyL8QwZ)\n\n\n## **What’s coming up**\n\n\n### **Universal Publishing**\n\n\nWe’re ready to launch our first key step towards a vision we’re describing as Universal Publishing. This is a vision for Buffer to be able to help with publishing all types of content, to almost any imaginable channel. While Buffer can help to varying degrees when it comes to fully automatically publishing the content, we can do much more to help with planning, scheduling and providing reminders to share content. We can tee it up and just need the user to hit publish themselves. For our first step, we are getting ready to roll out a way to share more types of content formats to Instagram, via a way to toggle any post (feed post, reel, story) to become a mobile notification. This will allow users to plan and schedule all of their Instagram content, and still add unique content features such as trending audio and stickers (unavailable via API) at the time of posting.\n\n\n### **Engineering Leadership \u0026 Product Management meetups**\n\n\nDuring November, we have our Engineering Leadership team and our Product Management team gathering together at meetups in Barcelona and Miami respectively. These meetups are very well timed with some recent structure and strategy changes as well as for looking ahead to 2024.\n\n\nThat’s a wrap for our October update. Thanks for your continued support!\n\n\n— Joel Gascoigne, Founder CEO\n\n",

As always, hit reply to share any comments or ask questions.\n\n\n\u003e 📊 [MetricsTable]  \n\u003e _Check out this post on_ [_buffer.com/shareholders_](/6d72d21488984f0f9c02f967cc2967c7) _to see the metrics table._\n\n- _We’ve seen another relatively flat month, with a slight MRR decline of 0.3%. This flat state is our new normal, and while we are working hard to move towards growth, it is a welcome change from our prior decline trend. Relative to decline, being flat is growth, and so we feel confident our trajectory in the upcoming 6-12 months._\n- _We’re continuing to see customers decline faster than we’d like. We’re still seeing healthy growth of customers on our New Buffer segment, therefore these declines are coming from our legacy cohort churning at a slightly faster pace than New Buffer._\n- _Monthly Active Users has remained flat, while we have seen growth in signups throughout the year. This is something we want to see change in the coming couple of quarters._\n- _We’re putting some extra focus on activation, onboarding and growth for New Buffer to help here, as well as looking towards New Buffer continuing to take over even more as the dominant segment. These different pieces I believe will get us towards customer growth._\n- _Average Revenue Per User has continued to grow at a healthy pace. This is occurring largely due to the increasing number of channels / social networks we support within Buffer. It’s great to see ARPU grow without any pricing changes in the past 2 years, which indicates that our strategy of serving wider use cases while keeping the entry point of the product accessible can work._\n- _With a consistent net loss of around $50k in the past 3 months, we are close to breaking even. With some slight growth as well as a little diligence in our expenses, we believe we can break even again in the next year, and start to see profitability and growth in the profit margin. This is important to us for our goal to exist and thrive for the long-term._\n\n## **Note-worthy updates and reflections**\n\n\n### **Notes**\n\n\nDuring September we launched a significant upgrade to our collaboration functionality with Notes. This allows customers to add context to their posts and communicate with team members in their Buffer account and work together to shape and finalize content before it is posted. Notes are also available to solo Buffer users, and take the form of internal notes which can serve as reminders for yourself for later. Notes is available on all plans, including free. [Read more](https://buffer.com/collaborate)\n\n\n### **Quick Navigator**\n\n\nWe also launched what we’re calling our Quick Navigator, which is a navigation menu you can open by hitting the CMD+K / CTRL+K keyboard shortcut, or from the Help menu in our navigation. This is a pattern that has been established in the past few years, which felt particularly powerful for us to implement for users. Through this menu, you can easily navigate to various tools within Buffer, to specific channels, and various parts of your account. [Read more](https://support.buffer.com/hc/en-us/articles/18536387721363-Work-smarter-with-Quick-Navigator)\n\n\n## **Q3 reflection**\n\n\nQ3 2023 was our best Q3 since 2020 in terms of MRR growth rate, with a tiny 0.07% decline quarter-over-quarter from Q2. 2023 continues to be a turnaround year, and we’re now far enough into the year to feel confident in this outcome. At our current pace, we are on track for a 1.25% decline. This is a significant improvement from our 7.57% decline in 2022. The entirety of the decline occurred in Q1, and we have been flat since then. This puts us in a very strong position heading into the new year, with a real opportunity to see growth in 2024.\n\n\nWe’re now seeing consistently flat results. This is something we’re celebrating as we had 3 years of decline while we shifted our strategy including our pricing, positioning and packaging. At our scale ($18M ARR, 55,000+ customers), generally the trajectory is fairly predictable and therefore it is quite difficult to “turn the ship” and see immediately different results. We’ve been putting significant effort into this turnaround, and it’s wonderful to see the fruits of our product, engineering, community, go to market and cultural shifts. With that type of predictability, it is unrealistic to go from decline to immediate growth, and we now find ourselves in the transitionary flat period.\n\n\nFrom here, our work is to follow through to a phase of healthy growth and thriving for the company. This is something that we’re all very excited about and are fully committed to making happen. Many in the team have joined during this challenging period of the company, and have enjoyed joining a company with strong values and a long-term focus, while having the opportunity to work on a real challenge of a turnaround. Others have been at the company for 7, 8, 9, even 10 years and have seen all the different phases and enjoy being at a company where we can weather these market and company challenges while staying true to our mission and values, and are happy to experience and contribute to the entire journey of getting back to healthy growth. With over 4 years of runway with our cash balance, we’re still in a very strong position as we see the light of growth ahead.\n\n\n## **What’s coming up**\n\n\n### **Tags**\n\n\nWe’re launching Tags soon, which will enable you to tag posts and ideas with one or more labels to give greater organization and workflow capabilities. This has been a top request for our Create space, one of the newest parts of the product which is getting a lot of positive feedback, but can fairly quickly become hard to manage. Tags are a significant upgrade to our prior Campaigns functionality, now allowing you to use multiple tags. We’re rolling this out to all plans, and there will be a limit of 3 tags for the free plan which should be enough to get some real value, while also providing a powerful upgrade path to our paid plans.\n\n\n### **New Salary System**\n\n\nWe’re close to finalizing our new salary system, which we will roll out internally in the next month. We’ve switched our salary data source from Radford to Carta, which feels more better suited to our industry and size of company. It has given us much simplified and more accurate benchmarks for the roles in the company. We’ve worked for many months on the salary system, and it will resolve a lot of debt that has built up over the years in our salary formula, which had led to discrepancies at times across areas and roles. The work on this has also led to a very healthy revisiting of levels of roles and individuals across the company, to resolve any inconsistencies which had built up there too. It’s a big step forward for us in terms of our commitment to transparency, simplicity, consistency and fairness.\n\n\n### **New company-wide support tool**\n\n\nAfter using Zendesk for 4 years, we are very excited to return to Help Scout which we used for the majority of our journey. We switched to Zendesk for a number of helpful capabilities as we scaled, and for bringing all of our support channels together. Over time, however, we found that Zendesk was overkill for our needs, had a variety of different bugs and issues which degraded the customer service experience, and we also decided to approach channels in a native way rather than bringing it all together. Something we lost with the switch 4 years ago which was culturally significant, was our ability to have a seat for everyone in the company and easy access to read and respond to customers’ emails. We’re delighted that with our new Help Scout contract, we’ve been able to work with them so that everyone in the team can have a login and use the tool. This is a big step forward as part of our overall strategy of viewing our customer communication tools as shared tools rather than owned purely by a single area.\n\n\nThanks for reading! I’ll be back in touch soon with the October update.\n\n\n— Joel Gascoigne, Founder CEO\n\n",

It also makes our Net Income Before Tax and Net Income numbers much more aligned, which is more further reason for the change.\n- It’s great to see another month of small growth as we see our journey back to growth continue. Notably, we’ve not had a three month streak in MRR gains since July - September of 2020.\n- To be transparent, we would not have achieved MRR growth for August had it not been for us welcoming our largest customer of the year so far on August 30, a new $1.5k MRR customer on our agency plan. Regardless, we’ll take the win!\n- Our runway continues to be very healthy at over 5 years, which is allowing us to be patient as our numbers improve again.\n- I’m keeping an eye on the decline in customers. Over time, our goal is to see us start growing customers again as a key part of our growth engine. Currently, the decline is coming entirely from churn of our legacy cohort, whereas we are continuing to see healthy growth of new customers on our current offering and pricing.\n\n## **Note-worthy updates and reflections**\n\n\n### **Facebook Reels scheduling** \n\n\nWith this addition, Buffer users can now auto-publish Reels to Facebook. This completes our lineup of short form video channels alongside Instagram Reels, TikTok and YouTube Shorts. With the rise of repurposing content across channels, Buffer is now an incredibly powerful tool to get maximum distribution by creating short form video content once and sharing it across these four channels which each have massive audience opportunities.\n\n\n### **Mailchimp email capture from your Start Page** \n\n\nWe’ve added the ability for users to add an email subscriber signup form to their microsite built using our Start Page offering. This adds a real tangible level of value and a clear conversion and ROI that users can gain from their Start Page, which is a link many put in their bio across social media profiles. It’s exciting to add something here that continues to push our offering well beyond social, and in particular growing an email list is something we highly recommend in order to really own the connection with an audience.\n\n\n### **Start Page incident with Meta**\n\n\nOn August 23, our Start Page domain start.page was incorrectly flagged as malicious content across all Meta products (Facebook and Instagram). We rallied and reached out to every contact we had at Meta and eventually were able to get help to resolve the issue. In the process, we’ve strengthened our partnership with Meta and made a number of improvements to verification of our domain with Meta and moderation approaches on our end to avoid this happening in the future.\n\n\n## **What’s coming up**\n\n\n### **New design system and UX improvements**\n\n\nAs part of the Visual Refresh project I mentioned last month, we’re working on upgrading our design system and components which will lead us to a much more modern feeling Buffer experience. This is a big initiative for a product that has existed for so many years, and so we’re taking a very iterative approach to reaching our ideal end state.\n\n\n### **Company Retreat in early 2024**\n\n\nWe’re in the midst of planning our first whole company retreat since the pandemic. We’ll all be gathering somewhere together in early 2024. At this point, whilst we’ve had smaller team meetups that most folks have attended in the past year, over half the team have not attended a Retreat, which has always been a very meaningful and productive experience. We’re excited to not only resume this important Buffer tradition, but reshape the retreat to match our current team, strategy and culture.\n\n\nThat’s a wrap for the August update. Thanks for your continued support!\n\n\n— Joel Gascoigne, Founder CEO\n\n",

See below for July numbers, notable updates and what’s coming up. Reply to this email if you have any comments or questions.\n\n\n\u003e 📊 [MetricsTable]  \n\u003e _Check out this post on_ [_buffer.com/shareholders_](/6d72d21488984f0f9c02f967cc2967c7) _to see the metrics table._\n\n- We’ve seen another month of slight growth, it is great to see that our trajectory continues along our expected path of flat to small growth.\n- At this stage it feels clear that we’ve stalled our decline and are on our way to some months of growth ahead. We are working hard to achieve higher growth, and ensure that we aren’t on our way to a growth ceiling down the line.\n- In July we experienced a lighter month on the cash receipts side, which contributed to the bank balance decrease. Some of this is related to seasonality, for example we collected about $64K less in annual subscription payments than we did in June.\n- Despite current losses we have very solid runway which allows us to continue to be patient and take a long-term view.\n- We plan to keep our team size stable which will allow us to work back to profitability as we see growth months.\n\n## **Note-worthy updates and reflections**\n\n\n### **Buffer Build Week 2023** \n\n\nWe had our second annual company-wide Build Week in July. This is an event where we take a week to work in a small 3-5 person group with people we don’t normally work with and a goal to ship something of value to customers or the team. The emphasis is on shipping value, and building connections and understanding across the company. This year’s event was a great success; we had 19 small teams and shipped a ton of value. [Read more.](https://buffer.com/resources/build-week-2023/)\n\n\n### **Buffer Suggestions** \n\n\nWe’ve launched a new feedback hub for customers to request features and improvements, and vote and comment on existing ideas. This is a significant step towards our strategy of embedding customers much more into how we work and build as a company. We’ve moved from a Typeform which was not transparent to the community, to a transparent suggestions board that keeps us more accountable to our customers. We’ve already found this to be a goldmine of insights for us in building the product. [View the suggestions board.](https://suggestions.buffer.com/)\n\n\n### **Open Beta**\n\n\nAs part of rolling out Buffer Suggestions, we’ve also launched an Open Beta program. In the past we’ve included customers in the rollout of new functionality, however this was done through a closed beta approach where we would reach out specifically to a subset of customers and invite them to try new features. With Open Beta, we’ve made it possible for any user to opt in to access and receive new functionality on beta in advance of it launching to the wider customer base. We have a new page in Buffer Accounts where users can view all the current functionality in beta, enable or disable beta at any time, and a button to share feedback (this links to the Buffer Suggestions page for that feature). [Check out Open Beta within Buffer Account.](https://account.buffer.com/beta?ref=buffer.com)\n\n\n### **Referral Program**\n\n\nOne of the Build Week projects was to create an MVP for a referral program. This is something we had in the earlier days, but dropped over the years as we experimented with moving more towards B2B SaaS. Now that our strategy is firmly in supporting small businesses, entrepreneurs and creators, we are taking inspiration from B2C SaaS and a referral program is a key way we’ve identified that we can leverage our brand and enable our happy users to invite people from their network to use Buffer. At this stage, we have built the groundwork to allow for tracking of referrals, and even without incentives yet in place for referring Buffer to others, we have seen quite a number of people go ahead and do so. [See our Help Article on the Referral Program.](https://support.buffer.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042816994-Does-Buffer-have-a-referral-program-)\n\n\n## **What’s coming up**\n\n\n### **Revamped Reminders** \n\n\nWe’re in the midst of upgrading how Reminders work for Instagram, with plans to roll out these improvements to all channels. Reminders is the approach we’ve used for years to support channels or functionality that we can’t offer due to it not being part of APIs. For example, adding trending audio or stickers to Instagram posts. We’ve now realized that Reminders should be a first-class experience alongside our standard publishing capabilities, as there are many situations where you’d want to add final polish or native functionality to posts. We’ll be renaming the feature, and allowing users to choose on a per-post basis whether to publish fully automatically, or to get a phone notification to add final touches.\n\n\n### **Visual Refresh** \n\n\nAs part of our push to double down on freemium and serving individuals as well as businesses, we are in the midst of a visual refresh project. This will bring a visual upgrade to the web dashboard, and pave the way for better UX, a responsive experience and themes (dark mode). It will also make it easier for us to significantly improve accessibility of the Buffer product.\n\n\n### **Equity + Salary updates** \n\n\nFor a few months, I’ve been working with our head of finance Jenny to revisit our equity and salary formulas. We’ve gone all the way to rethinking these from first principles, and in the coming months we plan to roll out a new stock options plan for the team, and transition to a new salary system which will simplify how salaries are calculated and remove some discrepancies which have been introduced over the years.\n\n\nThanks for reading - I’ll be back soon with the August update!\n\n\n— Joel Gascoigne, Founder CEO\n\n",

See below for June numbers, a Q2 reflection as well as key updates and what’s on the horizon. If you have any questions or comments, hit reply to discuss.\n\n\n\u003e 📊 [MetricsTable]  \n\u003e Check out this post on [buffer.com/shareholders](http://buffer.com/shareholders) to see the metrics table.\n\n- We’re very happy to see our holding steady pattern continue and in fact see a slight increase in MRR for June.\n- We’re keeping an eye on the customer decline, which is solely tied to the legacy cohort of customers declining. Our New Buffer cohort (new pricing since mid-2021) continues to grow at a healthy pace. I expect that at some point in the second half of the year, we will see churn of the legacy cohort slow down, and we should see growth for this metric.\n- We saw a number of annual renewals, as well as elevated employee expenses (severance + new teammates) which contributed to the unusual level of decline in our bank balance. Another contributor was our increased Twitter costs which have now kicked in.\n- Despite our current losses we have very solid runway which allows us to continue to be patient and take a long-term view.\n\n## **Note-worthy updates and reflections**\n\n\n### **YouTube Shorts** \n\n\nThe big update for June was that we launched YouTube Shorts scheduling in Buffer, and as part of that launched YouTube as a new channel. This has already been by far our most successful channel addition in recent years, which is not hugely surprising given how requested YouTube has been for a while. We chose to launch initially with Shorts, which was a lighter lift due to the similarity to Reels and TikTok. Over time, we plan to consider how we can effectively support longer form video scheduling to YouTube and add more value for this channel. [Read more](https://buffer.com/library/how-to-schedule-youtube-shorts/)\n\n\n### **Revamped Post Analytics**\n\n\nWe’ve started the process of upgrading Post Analytics across all channel types. With our launch of YouTube Shorts, we rolled out our new approach for Post Analytics, and we plan to have Post Analytics for all channels by the end of the year (including Mastodon, TikTok, Start Page, Google My Business).\n\n\n## **Q2 reflection**\n\n\nLooking year-over-year, Q2 2023 has been our best quarter since Q2 2021. So far, the 2023 trajectory is far better than any of the past 3 years. It is clear that we are in a turnaround situation, a turnaround year. We’ll need to keep up our current momentum and execution, but so far 2023 is looking like a great year and change in trajectory for Buffer.\n\n\nReflecting quarter-over-quarter, Q2 2023 was significantly better than Q1 2023. In Q1 we declined 1.2% in MRR, whereas in Q2 we declined just 0.11%. In terms of customers, in Q1 we declined 1.03%, whereas in Q2 we declined 0.87%. All metrics are trending better when comparing Q2 to Q1, and when comparing 2023 YTD to 2022.\n\n\nWhen it comes to leading indicator metrics for Q2, it has been a solid quarter. We had 232,938 signups, which was 38.02% higher than Q2 2022 where we had 168,775 signups. This level of growth is significant for us, as signups is now a key focus for us with our down and wide strategy focused on serving individuals as well as businesses, and our need for volume as well as revenue per customer.\n\n\nAnd when it comes to ARPU, this metric has remained relatively stable. We grew ARPU 0.77% compared to Q1, and it has grown 0.11% YoY from Q2 2022. We are happy with this stability, as ARPU is not a metric we are currently focused on growing. Instead, MRR and Customers are metrics we are focused on stabilizing and then finding growth in again.\n\n\nThanks for reading - I’ll be back in touch in a couple of weeks with the July update.\n\n\n— Joel Gascoigne, Founder CEO\n\n",

I’m here with a shareholder update for both April and May of 2023. See below for the numbers, key updates, and what’s on the horizon. If you have any questions, as always hit reply to discuss.\n\n\n\u003e 📊 [MetricsTable id=17]  \n\u003e _Check out this post on_ [_buffer.com/shareholders_](/6d72d21488984f0f9c02f967cc2967c7) _to see the metrics table._\n\n\nAnd for May:\n\n\n\u003e 📊 [MetricsTable]  \n\u003e _Check out this post on_ [_buffer.com/shareholders_](/6d72d21488984f0f9c02f967cc2967c7) _to see the metrics table._\n\n- In several of the past shareholder updates, I’ve mentioned the VAT payment we’ve been preparing for. In May we made this payment to the HMRC, and this project is now all wrapped up. As a reminder, this was a tax liability we had to pay related to consumer customers located in the UK. The reason it is a large sum, is that we were required to backdate our tax liability for several years. We’re glad to be done with this item, and overall we were very happy with the impact, which was lower than we initially anticipated. Even after our payment, we have 58 months (4 years, 10 months) runway based on our $4.4M cash.\n- I would describe our current growth situation as being in a holding pattern. We’ve hit a level of stability in our MRR that we’ve been working towards for a couple of years, as we shifted and solidified our strategy for longer term growth. While we’re not where we want to be, which is consistent healthy growth, this is a clear step towards that place and we’re glad to be in a new phase rather than the declines we’ve been seeing for a while. And in a flat phase, our runway gives us plenty of time to continue the diligent work that has led to us stalling the decline, to find growth soon.\n- It’s worth noting that the segment of customers on our current product and pricing offering is continuing to grow at a healthy pace (4.42% and 4.21% MRR growth in April and May respectively). Our declines are caused by the legacy segment who continue to churn out gradually, due to that segment having a higher average revenue per customer than the New Buffer segment. New Buffer is the product, pricing and packaging update we rolled out in mid-2021, which most notably is priced by channels (social accounts) rather than having tiers with a fixed number of channels included, and consolidated separate products into a single price.We’ve been successful in achieving higher volumes and solid growth with New Buffer, and we chose not to force a migration thus far for the legacy customers since the pricing model is so different and customer goodwill is vital to our strategy.\n\n## **Note-worthy updates**\n\n\nHere are a variety of the updates and improvements we’ve rolled out in the past couple of months:\n\n\n### **Revamped Zapier Integration** \n\n\nWe rolled out a significant upgrade to Buffer’s Zapier functionality. This involved upgrading to Zapier’s new code-based builder, which has enabled us to more easily add functionality in the future as well. For customers, this upgrade has enabled a wide range of new options for Triggers and Actions to allow integrating Buffer with other products. We’ve added 4 new triggers: New Draft, New Queue Item, New Contribution (for approval) and New Idea. On the Actions side of things, the significant one is that you can now add Ideas to Buffer’s Content section via Zapier, and you can also pause your queue. With these upgrades, we are now a Zapier Gold Partner, which gives us new co-marketing opportunities. And in April, we were prominently [featured on their blog](https://zapier.com/blog/whats-new-zapier-april-2023/). [Read more](https://buffer.com/resources/buffer-zapier-integration/).\n\n\n### **Stripe Checkout and Stripe Tax** \n\n\nWe migrated a significant portion of our billing interface to Stripe Checkout. In doing this, we’ve been able to offload the maintenance of this portion of our account section to Stripe, who have a whole team working to make sure the experience is optimized. This is one of those things that wasn’t available years ago when we built out our billing system, but would be a no brainer to go with if starting a SaaS product today. We’ve been making a number of these types of decisions in recent years (e.g. adopting Segment and Mixpanel for product analytics rather than managing our own data pipelines). The other key reason we made this change, is to make use of Stripe Tax to assist with collecting required tax information to start charging a variety of different sales and value added tax, depending on the location of the customer.\n\n\n### **AI in the main composer + post suggestions** \n\n\nWe launched the first version of our AI capabilities in February, which were only available in our Content space. This was a great place to start testing out how we could use AI to help customers. Even with the limited scope of AI in our first offering, it has already assisted in creating over 31,500 posts for 8,100 users, generating 2.5 million words. In April we launched the Buffer AI Assistant in the main composer across all channels, and we’ve added a set of clear options to work with posts: rephrase a posts, summarize long-form text, expand sentences into paragraphs. Additionally, we launched a post idea generator in our Content space, to help solve the blank page problem. [Read more](https://buffer.com/resources/why-were-doubling-down-on-ai-at-buffer/).\n\n\n### **Instagram Stories Scheduling** \n\n\nWe launched direct scheduling for Instagram Stories, a recent addition to the Instagram API. This is a wonderful step in completing Instagram as a fully fledged channel within Buffer - you can now schedule Posts (image and video), Reels and Stories and have them posted directly to Instagram without the need for a mobile notification, or opening the IG app. [Read more](https://buffer.com/resources/instagram-stories-auto-scheduling/).\n\n\nThanks for reading. I’ll be back in early July with the next update.\n\n\n— Joel Gascoigne, Founder CEO\n\n",

See below for our numbers, updates, and what’s coming up. If you have any questions or something stands out, don’t hesitate to hit reply to discuss.\n\n\n\u003e 📊 [MetricsTable]  \n\u003e _Check out this post on_ [_buffer.com/shareholders_](/6d72d21488984f0f9c02f967cc2967c7) _to see the metrics table._\n\n- We’re certainly celebrating our March results over here. We’ve had increases across the board other than a tiny decrease in paying customers.\n- Most of our numbers have been gradually improving over the course of many months, so it genuinely feels like we’re seeing the bottom of our decline. Time will tell, but April is already off to a strong start.\n- Notably, MAU has now increased for 7 of the last 8 months and is up 13% overall in that 8 month period.\n- The growth this month is small, however it has taken a lot of diligent effort to get here (more systemic change of our product and culture, rather than growth hacks and short cuts). Therefore, I believe that we are strongly placed to see compounding improvements to our numbers into the future, so long as we can continue strong strategy and execution.\n- Our runway is based on the average monthly burn for the past 12 months, and this number is down to $69,863. Notably, the past few months burn rate has been much lower than this, so I expect our runway to continue to increase. It also takes into account our expected VAT liability estimated at $1.2m, however we expect this number to come in slightly lower, and will be paid within the next 1-2 months. At that point, we will see this runway number refreshed and likely even higher. Still, 53 months is already 4 years and 5 months, so we’re in a very solid place.\n- Despite a slow decline for a long period now (around 20 months to be precise), I’m proud of the fact that we came into this period with a very healthy cash balance and runway, and have been able to avoid layoffs while they have been very prevalent across the industry. I believe that this strengthens our culture and trust, and will enable us to continue to have stronger collaboration and results ahead.\n\n## **Note-worthy updates and reflections**\n\n\n### **AI for highlighted text and new prompts** \n\n\nIn early March we rolled out a new set of features for our beta AI integration in our Ideas space. Users can now highlight text within an Idea and choose to Rephrase, Summarize or Expand that content. It’s also still possible to simply click “Generate” and have us generate content based on the text in the Idea. This acts more as a prompt to create content, whereas the new functionality works with existing content to rework it in some way. AI is of course a very fast-moving new technology with almost unlimited potential, so we are increasing our investment and focus on it accordingly. Stay tuned for much more here in the coming months.\n\n\n### **Keeping Buffer Free campaign** \n\n\nOn March 31, we launched our Keeping Buffer Free campaign, something we had been working towards for a couple of months. This was a campaign we came up with related to Hootsuite’s decision to remove their Free plan on that date, however the campaign became a larger message of commitment to our entrepreneur, creator and small business customers and to keeping a free plan for Buffer. We had an incredible response to this campaign, both to our overall message ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/buffer/status/1641501709233971201), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CqbDOYMO51h/)) shared through our Buffer social channels, as well as to [my Twitter Thread](https://twitter.com/joelgascoigne/status/1641572486520217600?s=20) I wrote sharing more of my thinking on freemium as part of our strategy. _Ask: I’d be really grateful if you could reshare one of these posts with your network, if this feels like useful content for them._\n\n\n### **Stripe Checkout to facilitate tax collection** \n\n\nWe are clearly moving into a world with more complexity and regulation around selling SaaS products globally. We’ve felt this with the increased accountability for VAT collection, and for a while now we’ve been paying state sales tax in many cases. Going forward, we have made the decision that it will make sense to be transparent with the customer, and also apply that tax to the price. This is a change from a singular price that always applies, to a singular price which will have eligible taxes added that differ based on the customer’s location. In preparation for this, we rolled out Stripe Checkout to replace our existing checkout system. This is going to make rolling out this type of tax collection much easier in the coming months.\n\n\n**Upwards Manager reviews** - During March, we conducted a round of reviews however in the opposite direction to usual. Instead of managers reviewing their team, we had individuals reviewing their manager. This gets us towards more fully rounded feedback (akin to 360), yet with the work required happening at different times. This is the first time we’ve done a real upwards review like this, and we’ve had great feedback from both individuals and managers about this new ability to share feedback, and gain those valuable insights into their leadership.\n\n\n## **What’s coming up**\n\n\n### **AI in the main composer** \n\n\nDuring April, we will be adding AI functionality to the main composer. Whereas the Ideas section is used by 8% of monthly active users, our main composer is used by 91%. Therefore, getting AI into the main composer is going to be a very significant step in our AI functionality and market position. We’re also digging deeper into UX improvements to ensure that we are adding AI functionality in the right way to truly reduce friction and help users get more value from Buffer, or speed up the pace of getting value.\n\n\n### **YouTube Shorts**\n\n\nWe’ve been working hard on building out YouTube Shorts as a channel within Buffer, and this should be ready to launch towards the end of April or in early May. YouTube has been the most requested channel addition to Buffer for a long time, and YouTube Shorts will be our foray into this massively popular channel. We’re starting with Shorts as this will allow us to provide significant value with a feature that closely matches our existing functionality (Instagram Reels, TikTok). We plan to expand to fully support YouTube videos in the future, too.\n\n\n### **Finalizing our new Twitter API contract**\n\n\nAfter a frantic January and February of intense discussions with Twitter around the future of their API, we’ve heard from them again after a couple of months of them being quieter. They needed more time to arrive at a clear direction ahead, and we’re expecting to have that clarity within April. This will mean we finalize the new price for our API contract, and we expect to see roughly a doubling of this cost. This will impact our COGS and profitability and put us further away from profitability again, however with growth likely ahead I believe we will be able to recoup this cost. Ultimately, this means that the cost of providing Twitter is very high for us, and we do not make too much for providing Twitter to customers. Twitter is instead more of a required piece of the channel mix customers expect. With that said, there is a possibility that this consolidation of the market is to our favor and we see growth in Twitter usage within Buffer as people need to move from other platforms that can’t afford the API price increase.\n\n\nThanks for reading, and for your support for Buffer.

See below for our numbers, updates, and what’s coming up. As always, hit reply with comments or questions.\n\n\n\u003e 📊 [MetricsTable]  \n\u003e _Check out this post on_ [_buffer.com/shareholders_](/6d72d21488984f0f9c02f967cc2967c7) _to see the metrics table._\n\n- It’s been great to see our pace of MRR decline slow very consistently over the past 3 months since we introduced our self-serve legacy migration hub.\n- MRR decline was -1.87% in December, -1.38% in January and now -0.60% in February.\n- As a reminder, the migration hub allows our legacy customers to easily switch over to our new pricing, and for many of them this has been a price decrease, which is why we’ve seen an overall MRR decline, while the New Buffer segment has been growing healthily.\n- We’re very happy to see continued strong growth of Monthly Active Users. Note: there was an error in the numbers last month, where I shared a -3.26% change in MAU. The actual change was +5.56%.\n- We’ve also seen our runway increase by a few months. We’re very glad to have a solid runway while we work back to growth and profitability.\n\n## **Note-worthy updates and reflections**\n\n\n### **Our banking position** \n\n\nBuffer does not have any significant exposure to Silicon Valley Bank. Many years ago we moved over to Bridge Bank (part of Western Alliance Bank). The only potential minor impact to us of the events around SVB is that our UK bank account is with them. This is used purely for payroll and is kept at under $200K, only around 3.5% of our cash. We’re keeping an eye on the situation and whether there is any further fallout, as well as generally considering how we can best insulate ourselves from these types of outcomes.\n\n\n### **Buffer’s AI Assistant**\n\n\nWe launched our AI assistant in early February, and it has been very well received. So far, we’ve integrated this into our Ideas section, and we plan to add it to the main composer soon. We’ve already followed up with an improvement that enables specific options for rephrasing, expanding and summarizing content. We’re also planning to add an AI Assistant feature to generate new content ideas based on your existing content. [More here.](https://buffer.com/ai-assistant)\n\n\n### **Integrations in Ideas area** \n\n\nWe’re continuing to improve the Ideas composer, and have added a variety of integrations to our existing Canva integration. Our complete list is now: Canva, Dropbox, Google Drive, One Drive, Google Photos, Giphy and Unsplash.\n\n\n### **Post previews**\n\n\nWe’ve launched post previews for Instagram, Facebook and LinkedIn. This is a new recent feature we added, and it’s incredibly useful for customers, removes friction and builds trust and confidence in Buffer, as they can see exactly what their posts will look like when they share them to the networks. [More here.](https://twitter.com/buffer/status/1630931405700988930?s=20)\n\n\n## **What’s coming up**\n\n\n### **Twitter API changes** \n\n\nAfter some intense negotiations, calculations and strategic decision making during February, Twitter pushed back the date multiple times and then shared they would be taking [a few more weeks](https://twitter.com/TwitterDev/status/1626732269174943745) to make the planned changes. We’re in a holding pattern currently as we wait for more information, however we expect that things will go as planned and we will see a fairly significant increase of our Twitter costs which will directly increase our COGS. We are in a position to be able to absorb this.\n\n\n### **YouTube as a channel**\n\n\nWe’re working hard to prepare to launch YouTube as a channel within Buffer. We will be starting out with YouTube shorts, which are the closest to existing content formats we already support (TikTok and Instagram Reels), and will allow us to get something out sooner and then iterate. We plan to support full YouTube videos in the future, too.\n\n\n### **Ideas area tagging \u0026 organization**\n\n\nWe’re working on adding organizational features in the Ideas section of Buffer. The key functionality we’re planning to add is tagging and filtering of ideas based on tags. We’re also revisiting our campaigns functionality and will likely align this with tagging, so that it flows from ideas to drafts to published content to analytics. Idea Created has recently surpassed Comment Replied (use of engagement) and Start Page Published (use of Start Page) as a contributor to our Monthly Active Usage ([see chart](https://share.cleanshot.com/fj3kXybW)). AI was a key contributor of this, and we believe that adding organizational features will further increase usage of Ideas. Our overall hypothesis is to move earlier in the creation process, where we believe that people will have an order of magnitude more ideas than published posts, and we are confident that connecting these tasks can streamline the overall workflow for users.\n\n\nThat’s a wrap for our February update. Thanks for your continued support!\n\n\n— Joel Gascoigne, Founder CEO\n\n",

Here are our January numbers of key leading indicators, and growth compared to December:\n\n- Signups: 81,971 (+30.11%)\n- Activations: 23,019 (+25.78%)\n- New customers: 3,614 (+35.10%)\n\nWe’re still seeing a decline top-line, however in the coming months as we maintain strong leading indicators and see our legacy customers continue to migrate to our latest pricing, we expect to see a flattening of the decline and a shift to growth.\n\n\n### **Mastodon as a channel** \n\n\nOur big launch in January was Mastodon, and despite still being an emerging platform, we saw very high engagement and excitement around our support for Mastodon scheduling. [See all the details](https://buffer.com/mastodon) of our offering, and if you’re already on Mastodon then [follow Buffer here](https://mastodon.world/@buffer), and [I’m here](https://mastodon.social/@joelg)! Mastodon is a fundamentally different type of platform, being federated (essentially decentralized) and based on open standards. As a business built on a variety of networks, this is a unique type of network that makes sense for us to invest in. Mastodon is a key milestone for us, being our 10th channel.\n\n\n### **Twitter API changes**\n\n\nYou have likely spotted the API changes [announced via @TwitterDev](https://twitter.com/TwitterDev). This will unfortunately have an impact on us. Twitter is the largest line item of our COGS, and it is set to increase significantly. Thankfully, we have a 12-year relationship with Twitter and strong advocacy within the company and are working closely with them on a new package for our API access and usage levels. Customers will not be impacted on February 13, and we do not expect to make any immediate changes to our offering. Our goal is to maintain our offering and assure customers that we are a stable platform throughout the numerous changes that will happen over the coming weeks. \n\n\n## **What’s coming up**\n\n\n### **AI assisted functionality**\n\n\nWe’re launching our AI Assistant in open beta next week! We’re starting with AI as a writing sidekick within the composer in our new Ideas / Create section ([preview here](https://twitter.com/buffer/status/1603405877851070464)). We’re building this on OpenAI, and we plan to start with a lightweight credit system tiered based on the pricing plan a customer is on. As we see usage, we’ll be able to calibrate the pricing and figure out what makes sense overall. Our hope and expectation is that the AI Assistant is used in ways that lead people to share more via Buffer, so we see expansion of revenue that offsets our costs. This launch will put a stake in the ground that we are incorporating AI in a thoughtful, useful way and over time AI can pop up and help in many parts of the product.\n\n\n### **YouTube as a channel**\n\n\nWe’re in the discovery and design phase of building YouTube as a publishing channel within Buffer, and are aiming to launch in the next couple of months. We’ve found great success in adding new channels in the past year, and YouTube is of course a very significant one to add to the product. Since our pricing is per channel, we expect to see a positive impact to growth of rolling this out. We will be further along in development by next month’s update, so I’ll share a little more detail on the UX and functionality then.\n\n\nThanks for your support,\n\n\n— Joel Gascoigne, Founder CEO\n\n",

                                    "body": "\n\u003e ℹ️ _Sent to shareholders on January 13, 2023_\n\n\nHi,\n\nHappy 2023! I’m here to share Buffer’s December 2022 numbers and updates. Please hit reply with comments or questions. Let’s dive in:\n\n\n\u003e 📊 [MetricsTable]  \n\u003e _Check out this post on_ [_buffer.com/shareholders_](/6d72d21488984f0f9c02f967cc2967c7) _to see the metrics table._\n\n- December is typically our worst-performing month seasonally each year. This has been true for us here, however the December dip was less pronounced than we had expected.\n- As mentioned last month, we expect a higher pace of MRR decline for a few months as we have introduced a way for customers to migrate to our latest plans, and on average our new plans have a lower price point. This has been true for us and is part of the reason we have a fairly significant decline in MRR for December, when we combine the seasonal dip and the impact of migrations.\n- We are planning for a ~$1m reduction in cash in the coming months due to our VAT liability in the UK, so the bank balance and runway will see a drop soon when we handle that.\n\n## **Note-worthy updates and reflections**\n\n\n### **Twitter Threads**\n\n\nWe launched support for posting and scheduling Twitter Threads via Buffer. This has been one of the most highly requested features we’ve had and was a great launch. Usage looks solid and we had many positive comments via social, email, and in our Discord community. [More here.](https://buffer.com/resources/twitter-threads-buffer/)\n\n\n### **Customer experience**\n\n\nI thought it would be useful to highlight some of our incredible customer service numbers for 2022. We had 66k conversations with customers, which represented 7% of paying customers, and 3% of overall MAU. Our average first reply time was 3.1 hours, and 93.4% CSAT.\n\n\n### **VAT liability**\n\n\nLast month, I mentioned that we’ve been working through accounting for VAT liability we owe HMRC for UK customers dating back to 2015. The finance team, with help from the whole company and a new team of temporary contractors, have been very successful in minimizing the liability amount. We have been able to reduce the number from around $1m to roughly $800k. We will see this impact to our cash balance and runway in the coming months, and we are looking forward to being compliant and on the other side of this.\n\n\n## **What’s coming up**\n\n\n### **2023 strategy**\n\n\nWe will be continuing our strategy which we’ve made great strides on in 2022. The simplest way for me to describe our strategy would be “down and wide”. We’re shifting down-market to serve individuals (creators, entrepreneurs, influencers, professionals) as well as small businesses. This is a shift that we’ve already seen bear fruit in terms of an increase in signups from streamlining and simplifying our sign up process. The goal of going “wide”, is to increase the breadth of our product and serve customers beyond just their social media needs. The ultimate goal here is to increase our total addressable market, and diversify and insulate ourselves from the volatility of being purely in social media management.\n\n\n### **January looking good**\n\n\nObviously I’ll have a full update in a month, but it is worth highlighting that so far January has been off to a very good start. The first full week of January has been our best week in terms of signups in over 20 months. We’re feeling confident that our renewed focus on freemium, individuals, and acquisition will yield great, sustainable results and growth as we progress through the year.\n\n\n### **Mastodon support**\n\n\nWe’re working on supporting Mastodon as a channel within Buffer. Since Twitter’s change of ownership and the volatile product changes and experience, there has been a surge of growth for Mastodon. We’re moving fast to support Mastodon in Buffer, and we’re considering ways we can be involved in the community beyond this, too. Mastodon feels culturally and philosophically aligned with Buffer in many ways. Since pricing on our paid plans is now per channel, there is a good chance that introducing Mastodon support will also give us a slight bump in growth (it will also be available as one of 3 channels on the free plan). If you’re interested, we also put together a [Beginner’s Guide to Mastodon](https://buffer.com/resources/mastodon-social/).\n\n\n### **AI assisted functionality**\n\n\nWe are also working on integrating AI assistance into Buffer. We’re starting with AI as a writing sidekick within the composer in our new Ideas section ([preview here](https://twitter.com/buffer/status/1603405877851070464)), and are also looking into adding it as an image integration option similar to Canva or Giphy, where you can type a prompt, generate an image, and add that right into your social post.\n\nThat’s all for this month. Thank you for your support of Buffer.\n\n\n\n— Joel Gascoigne, Founder CEO\n\n",

This month, we saw an important win of growth in MAU, which is the most leading indicator in these metrics, and is our 4th straight month of MAU growth.\n- We had an unusually high net loss this month due to accounting for prepayments made in 2019/2020 which converted to credits now expiring for a retreat we cancelled due to the pandemic. This was not a direct cash impact, and without it net income would have been -$29,616.58.\n- We anticipate a higher pace of MRR decline in the coming months, as we have now launched a Migration Hub (more below) which allows users to easily switch from a legacy plan to a new plan, and since this is voluntary to begin with, we will initially see a higher volume customers switching who will see a price decrease.\n- We are planning for a ~$1m reduction in cash in the coming months due to our VAT liability in the UK, so the bank balance and runway will see a drop soon when we handle that.\n\n## **Note-worthy updates and reflections**\n\n\n### **Scheduling to Start Pages**\n\n\nAs a reminder, Start Page is our micro website builder or link in bio tool. At the beginning of November we launched the ability for anyone with a start page to include a block where they can share updates. The most powerful part of this is that you can use the regular Buffer composer to publish the updates. This is part of our continued focus on Start Page being our first native channel. [More here.](https://buffer.com/resources/new-from-start-page-schedule-posts-to-your-link-in-bio-for-free/)\n\n\n### **Ideas**\n\n\nWe recently launched Ideas, a brand new section of Buffer where users can save an idea for a post. We want to significantly reduce the friction of getting those ideas into Buffer, and working on them whenever is convenient. You can add an idea easily from the dashboard, or using our browser extensions. For Buffer, we see a powerful opportunity to drive more active usage by lowering the friction here, for example people are likely to have many more ideas than drafts, and many more drafts than posts. We’re also getting earlier in the workflow, by being part of the content creation process, rather than purely content publishing. [More here.](https://buffer.com/ideas)\n\n\n### **Migration Hub**\n\n\nA key strategic choice we made a couple of months ago, is to launch new value onto our newer pricing and packaging (we call this New Buffer internally). Legacy plans still account for around ~60% of paying customers and MRR, and the time feels right to accelerate the shift to the current plans. We’re not doing a forced migration at this point, instead the Migration Hub allows customers to very clearly see the difference between their legacy plan and the current plans, in terms of functionality and price. At this early stage in introducing the Migration Hub, we are experiencing an even steeper decline of MRR, and anticipate a few months of this before things taper off. This is due to the New Buffer plans being priced slightly lower relatively vs the legacy plans. This is part of our strategy to go down-market to serve individuals and small businesses. Whilst this period is a little painful to observe, it is also coming with our first growth in MAU in a long time. It is my belief that we need to rip the bandaid off here and get the majority of our user-base on New Buffer sooner. In that sense, we are seeing the results so far that we hoped to see.\n\n\n### **VAT**\n\n\nWe’ve been aware for some time that we may have a VAT liability to handle with the UK and EU, however the details have always been quite vague. In recent months, the UK in particular (HMRC) have increased their pressure on us and other SaaS companies to start accounting for, and paying, VAT for consumer customers. As a result of this, we conducted a deeper analysis of the requirements, and have been working with a consultant as well as connecting with other SaaS businesses experiencing the same situation. This unfortunately means that we ended up with a challenging and time consuming task of determining and verifying tax status for all UK customers dating back to 2015. We’ve thankfully made good progress and reduced our default VAT liability (if we did none of this verification and all customers were assumed consumers) for 2015-2022 from around $3m to under $1m. This does, however, mean we will see that ~$1m impact on our cash balance in the coming months. We will be accounting for this in the current year, so our net income will look quite significant, however this is not a recurring expense but rather a one off.\n\n\n## **What’s coming up**\n\n\nWe are still facing a gradual decline of MRR and customers, and it is our top priority to turn around this situation and work our way towards sustainable growth, without compromising on our values or the DNA of the company. I remain confident that we will achieve this, and that once we get to that place, because we will have done so without cutting corners, we will see a healthy future in terms of our company growth.\n\n\nIn the next few months, we're doubling down further on our strategy of serving creators and small businesses with a freemium product.\n\n\nWe've seen good signs in the past few months that this focus is helping us navigate our way to a new phase of sustainable growth, and it's also a gap which is largely unaddressed in the market. Most of the competitors at scale have moved up-market and leave a gap for small businesses, and newer products with a freemium strategy lack the breadth of offering we are able to provide.\n\n\nOur efforts here will include ensuring our offering is holistically structured as freemium, rather than just pieces of it (historically our publishing offering has been a strong freemium product but functionality we added on top has either been purely paid (analytics and engagement) or purely free (Start Page).\n\n\nOur top goals are to increase acquisition (we currently get around 65,000 signups per month and would like to be getting ~80,000 per month, and continuing to add value in a way that is holistically freemium. I’m happy to report that all features we added to Buffer this year included some version for free users. In the past few months, we've seen a greater impact from our launches as they have added value for almost all of our MAU, and this will continue to be our focus. I largely attribute our stalling of the decline, and recent growth of MAU to this shift. This is important because I expect that signups and MAU will be the leading indicators of a turnaround in our overall growth.\n\n\nOther efforts we are making to align with these product led growth efforts are rebuilding a vibrant community around Buffer, creating opportunities for some food to regularly try new functionality early, and continuing to provide exceptional customer service to all users. The goal is to create a loyal base of users who will bring us more users and customers through word of month.\n\n\n## **Asks**\n\n\nAs a company, we’d love to speak with people at companies who are focused on small businesses and individuals with a free plan, ideally at scale ($15-25m ARR). This is a less common approach than B2B / enterprise SaaS and so I'm looking to keep building my network of founders and CEOs to exchange learning and ideas with. We’d also love to talk with executives product managers, product marketers working on these types of products. If someone comes to mind, please hit reply and mention them, or go ahead and make an introduction.\n\n\nThat's all for this month. Please hit reply to share a thought or question. I’ll be sending updates monthly going forward. If you don't want to receive this, let me know or click the link at the bottom.\n\n\nThank you for your long-term support of Buffer,\n\n\n— Joel Gascoigne, Founder CEO\n\n",
